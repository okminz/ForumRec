<p>Those services are sort of expensive (usually $100+/workhour in a clean room, plus additional costs of e.g. donor parts or for more difficult problems (disk encryption etc.)). Keep in mind, that they usually WON'T CHARGE anything if they can't recover your data, but since this seems to be a mechanical fault, maybe inside the drive motor or HSA (head stack assembly) motor, I am quite confident that a mechanic could fix it.</p>

<p>The behaviour you observed is not uncommon - due to changing environmental factors (mainly temperature), devices you thought were dead will ""magically"" work again. But as a hard drive contains spinning parts, generating vibrational forces, a possible loose connection could get torn apart again after a few minutes running.</p>

<p>First, you presumably have the /path/to/studentsnumbers/ where you are finding the folder structure you list above.  Store that in a variable here we will call PathToStudNumbs.  </p>

<pre><code>PathToStudNumbs=""/path/to/studentsnumbers/""

<p>Next there are a couple of useful tools you will want to explore:  basename and dirname.  These will obtain information about the elements of a path to a specific file.  You may not need these for this case because all of the files you are changing are apparently named the same (coursework).  </p>

<p>Since we don't know how you are iterating over your directories, I leave it to you to sort out what use basename and dirname will be to your specific situation.  </p>

<p>Let's reframe how we see the current paths.  We can rework that to something containing the elements we care about using variables.  (I assume below the coursework number also changes over time.)  </p>

<pre><code>""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/coursework.thy""  
</code></pre>

<p>If you work this into a cp statement to a different directory, it would look something like this:  </p>

<pre><code>cp ""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/coursework.thy"" ""${PathToDestination}/${StudNumbs}_${courseworkNumb}.thy"" 
</code></pre>

<p>This would make a copy of the target file in a folder of your choosing where the new file would be named something like 123456_coursework1.thy (which is to say the student number, an underscore, the coursework number, and the file extension).  </p>

<p>Or you could rename the existing file in place with mv, something like this:  </p>

<pre><code>mv ""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/coursework.thy"" ""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/${StudNumbs}_${courseworkNumb}.thy""

Using only one 4-Pin connector halves the amount of +12V and GND pins to two (Instead four)
Despite your PSU featuring only single rail +12V, it really won't make that much difference if you use the 4-Pin connector only. The Core i7 8700k has a TDP of 95W (according to Intel) which the two +12V cables a 4-Pin connector features can handle. If you take a total of ~4 Amps per line (95W / (12V x 2)), that should work.

30389,0,"<p>Having a higher end CPU/GPU does not increase the maximum thermals the cooling solution can have.  In fact it only increases how much cooling is required.  Most laptops only have about 65-85 Watts TDP of cooling compared to a desktop which can often have 300-600 Watts TDP of cooling capability.  Being a 16 inch notebook, not a 24 inch, it would be in the 70-75 Watt TDP range.</p>

<p>In all honesty 60 degrees actually sounds about right.  Even desktop processors run around that temperature.  Intel CPUs are known to run hot, especially in macs. The same goes for nVidia GPUs which Apple uses.  Laptops in particular run very hot as well.  </p>

<p>As of fan noise, sadly that model laptop has a noisy fan.  You can reduce the fan noise by cleaning the fans.  It might also improve airflow.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are some other things you can do.</p>

<p>First, insure power-scaling is properly enabled.  You should have the lowest setting to the lowest it will go while maintaining the maximum top bracket settings.  This will properly enable the power save behavior to reduce wasted power and heat.  </p>

<p>You should never use so-called ""performance"" mode on your laptop, or anything except benchmarks for that matter.  The mode is a holdover from back when processors took a long time to power up after sleep mode.</p>

<p>Second, if you are only cloning a display across several monitors, use a Display Port signal cloning device instead of a multi-port adapter.  This will prevent the GPU from having to make extra copies of the screen data.  </p>

<p>Finally, depending on what browser you use you may have some option to reduce CPU and memory usage.  Chrome and Firefox have such options, Edge, Opera and Safari do not.</p>

<p>You should be able to remove it and see the extent of the damage.</p>

<p>After the corrosion is removed and the damage is assessed you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Repair the traces and solder back on the PS/2 connector.</li>
<li>Remove any residual shorts in the traces, and turn off the PS/2 connector in the BIOS.</li>

<p>Either option will make the board operational again, but option 1 will likely make the PS/2 connector work again.</p>

<p>As a note, if you chose Option 2 you don't have to worry about preserving as much of the traces as possible.</p>

<p>In the future, humidity can be kept out of your computer by adding a small pouch or container of silica gel humidity remover (which you can get at hardware stores) somewhere in the case.

<p>So - depending on your question and the comments below, I personally see two major ways (HW/SW) achieving a mouse that only works as a scroll wheel:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hardware approach: a mouse usually uses sensors like hall effect sensors, optical (laser) sensors or mechanically driven once (with a spinning ball inside) for the tracking of their movement. But you only need the scroll wheel, hence it could be an idea to (irreversible) cut the sensor wires so only the scroll wheel will be connected anymore.
But be aware: no input =/= no movement, as cutting the sensor off could potentially result in a floating state with unpredictable input (but this is not very likely, and if so - then pull it down with a resistor to ground</p></li>
<li><p>Software approach (preferred option 1): write your own script/driver for it which only takes use of the scroll wheel axis. <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/virtual-hid-framework--vhf-"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/virtual-hid-framework--vhf-</a></p></li>
<li><p>Build your own dedicated scroll wheel - without a mouse (preferred option 2): if you take the effort to write a script just for a scroll wheel - why don't you take an hour or so more to just build a dedicated scroll wheel, so nothing else but a scroll wheel. What you will need is a rotary encoder (better as an endless potentiometer IMHO, because they have already steppings) and program it to do the same kind of work. If you will go for the track ball, you could use a ball inside a housing with a rubber roll on the bottom that spins and drives a potentiometer or so.

<p>The simplest way to correct the tags is by doing so in WMP's library itself. Find the song in the library, right-click the piece of information that you want to correct (e.g. artist, title...), select <code>Edit</code>, and enter the new info.</p>

<p>If your current situation really does not allow you to use your OSD/the display buttons to change your current video source, I suggest looking into KVM-switches (which would eliminate the need for sets of peripherals (keyboard and mice) for each computer as a neat side effect).</p>
<p>Those can be usually placed on or under your desk and will allow some easy manual switching between KVM-controlled devices. There might be even some software to interface the KVM-switch, but that will be only found on some higher priced models.</p>

<p>In your IP address <code>15.243.21.1</code> when converted to binary digits</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>15</strong>: <code>00001111</code></li>
<li><strong>243</strong>: <code>11110011</code></li>
<li><strong>21</strong>: <code>00010101</code></li>
<li><strong>1</strong>: <code>00000001</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So it is a 32 Bits IP Address Sysytem</p>

<p>So IP address in text format would be combination of all these four digits.</p>

<p>So it will be:</p>

<pre><code>00001111111100110001010100000001

<p>The derivation is very easy and you can write a formula in Excel to convert your IP address in binary address. The hardware understands only <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. <code>0</code> means bit off <code>1</code> means bit is set on.</p>

<p>So entire computer hardware whatever it may be, the undergoing signals sent are sequences of <code>0</code>'s and <code>1</code>'s only. But what you see in the screen or printer is again converted back to readable form.</p>
