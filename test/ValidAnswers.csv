1606345,0,"<p>Currently, we use some logic in PowerShell to do a <code>netstat -ano</code> to get all TCP and UDP results and filter out results that we don't need to see then export it into a CSV.

<p>One example would be <code>netstat -ano  | Where-Object{$_ -notlike '*127.?.?.?*' -and $_ -notmatch '\[::1]' -and $_ -notmatch 'TIME_WAIT' -and $_ -notmatch 'CLOSE*' -and $_ -notmatch 'ESTABLISHED' -and $_ -notmatch 'SYN_*' -and $_ -notmatch 'FIN_*'}</code>.</p>

1606482,0,"<p>I recently set up a Raspberry Pi NAS. It has a USB 3.0 connection to a hard drive with a Raspberry Pi 4. The problem is that when I copy files with Samba I only get around 10 MiB/sec.</p>
<p>I know the problem isn't with the hard drive nor the USB 3.0 SATA connector. I copied a big file from the hard drive back to the hard drive itself and was getting around 80 MiB/sec. I also ran hdparm and it had a read value also around 80 MiB/sec. I checked the ethernet connection and it is connected with 100 Mbps link. When I ran speed test to the internet (just to check if I'm getting that 100 Mbps on the network), it did gave me values close to 100 Mbps.</p>
<p>From what I've seen as described above, I can conclude that the problem must be with Samba. I changed my file according to the <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/713248/home-file-server-using-samba-slow-read-and-write-speed"">first answer of this question</a>.</p>

<p>If this is not the correct place to post, please advise.  The OP is below:</p>
<p>I am testing a site for accessibility using ChromeVOX and I notice that the <p> tag content does not get read. When I tab through the main content, ChromeVOX simply skips over the <p> and reads the &lt;h#&gt; tags, and links.</p>
<p>I have watched the video: <a href=""https://youtu.be/OUDV1gqs9GA?t=2748"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/OUDV1gqs9GA?t=2748</a> and at this section, the narrator skips to the first  and then mentions a hotkey that will just let the screenreader continue to read all the text. However, narrator does not mention what that hotkey is.</p>
<p>I have looked at the ChromeVOX keyboard shortcuts, but I cannot find that one:</p>
<p><a href=""http://apps4android.org/chromevox/chromevox_keyboard_shortcuts_ref.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps4android.org/chromevox/chromevox_keyboard_shortcuts_ref.htm</a></p>
<p>Also, here is a link to a site to see how screen-readers work:</p>
<p><a href=""https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-semantics.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/html/good-semantics.html</a></p>
<p>When I navigate that site with ChromeVOX, it also does not read anything except for the  tag.</p>
<p>So, what is the keyboard shortcut or method to read the content in the <p> tags or role=&quot;main&quot; tag? Is there an aria tag that would include those paragraphs? As far as I can see, this behaviour is common across all sites.</p>

My setup is
AMD Ryzen 5 3500X
MSI B450-A Pro MAX
Colorful igame gtx 1660 super
Klevv bolt-X 2x8 GB
PSU be quiet system power 9 500W</p>
<p>The problem is, when first connected to power. My PC will always turn on by itself without pressing the button.
But if I not disconnect the power source / turn off the PSU (normal shutdown only), next time I can turn on my PC normal with pressing the power.</p>
<p>And &quot;Even If&quot; I disconnect the power source / turn off the PSU &quot;Not more than 5-10 minute&quot;. When I connect the power source / turn on PSU, It won't turn on automatically.</p>
<p>But If I disconnect the power source / turn off the PSU &quot;More than 10 minute&quot;. When I connect the power source / turn on PSU, It will always turn on automatically.</p>
<p>After so many test try using other PSU / RAM / Processor / Motherboard.
I find when I change the Motherboard, this problem is not happen.</p>
<p>But when I bring this to official MSI support center in my city. They say nothing wrong with their Motherboard and don't find any faulty there.
Can you guys help me what should I do? Or maybe something that i need to do to check my motherboard. Because I'm not an electrician expert, i can't check the mobo myself. Just trial and error.</p>
<p>And lastly even if my motherboard is okay, is this kind of problem gonna hurt my entire setup? Or is it just some small error that can be ignored. Thx before</p>

sort: Set LC_ALL='C' to work around the problem.

1606408,0,"<p>I would like to install a Matrix homesever on a VPS (running Debian 10) for the sole purpose of using the WhatsApp bridge, <code>mautrix-whatsapp</code>. I really only need to be able to communicate with my personal WhatsApp using a Matrix client, so there's no need to use federation or anything like that (AFAICT). Since this use is a bit different from common homeserver setups, I was hoping someone could elucidate a few things for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>The VPS in question mostly serves as an OpenVPN server. I would like to have the Matrix homeserver only accessible from clients connected to the VPN. To the OpenVPN clients, the server is accessible by IP at 192.168.xxx.1. Clients connect to the VPN by IP; there is no <em>externally</em> accessible FQDN associated with it. Is this going to be a problem? N.B. the VPN clients typically use the DNS server (Pi-hole) running on the VPS, which does allow them to reach the server by its hostname. Can I just use this hostname as the domain namee for Synapse and mautrix-whatsapp?</li>
<li>Port 443 is NOT available, because I redirect it to 1194 so clients can connect to the VPN on restrictive public networks. Although <a href=""https://www.natrius.eu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=digital:server:matrixsynapse"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a> says &quot;a reverse proxy should be reachable publicly with a regular certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt) on port 443 that goes to the port 8008 of synapse&quot;, I'm assuming things will work out just fine if I use a different port and point the Matrix client (Element) to it. Is that correct?</li>
<li>In fact, since the client connections will already be encrypted by virtue of OpenVPN, could I forgo the reverse proxy entirely? If so, is that sensible, and is there anything I need to know w.r.t. configuration, etc?</li>
<li>In this configuration, do either Synapse or mautrix-whatsapp require me to open ports to the outside world (i.e. outside of the VPN's 192.168.xxx.0/24)?</li>

1606805,0,"<p>I have a VS running Ubuntu 20.04 with working web server and email server. I connect a CentOS box to it via VPN from home. The CentOS also has a web server and Postfix email server. The web and email servers work on the CentOS box as long as (a) ports 80 and 25 are forwarded from the VS machine, and (b) CentOS is connected to VS machine with VPN. The conundrum is that both web servers (on VS and CentOS) are accessible from public Internet when port 80 is forwarded from VS, but email receiving works only on CentOS. Postfix on the VS rejects incoming mail with <code>Relay access denied</code>. If I remove forwarding port 25 Postfix on VS does receive mail, but CentOS will not. Same situation if I change master.cf on VS from smtp to smtps (not using the forwarded port 25). How can I set up the VS Postfix so it accepts incoming mail while port 25 is forwarded - just as Apache can serve web pages from both machines while port 80 is fowarded from the VS machine? Note: port forwarding and VPN access to the VS machine is necessary otherwise CentOS on home Internet access is restricted by ISP with blocking incoming ports 80 and 25.</p>

Recap, creating a scheduled task with the operator user to execute a script creating a file in the s:\ disk.
After realising it wasn't working, I tried breaking down the problem into steps. First I tried executing the powershell script with the operator user. The script is the following:</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why can I create the file in C:\Users\operator\Documents but not in C:\</li>
<li>Why do I have the run as administrator for it to work if operator is already the admin ?</li>
<li>Would the reason why my scheduled task is not working the same as why I can't write in c:\ ?</li>

<p>I installed Ubuntu 18.04 on both of them, and I noticed that even though the exact same version of Ubuntu was installed on both (Ubuntu Server 18.04.5 LTS), neither of them have any packages that can be upgraded, and the hardware is also the exact same between both machines (only difference is the NAS has a larger SSD and more RAM than the gateway, everything else is the same), these two machines have different kernel versions.</p>
<p>I know very little about the Linux kernel or what its different versions means.

Also possibly worth mentioning that neither of these machines came with an OS installed (or hard disk).</p>
<p>Both of these are running the same Ubuntu installation that I flashed onto a USB flash drive, both were installed onto new, fresh/blank SSDs.

1607333,1,"<p>I have an Excel workbook that has sheets that include columns where it is required to average the lowest 7 from 25 values excluding any with a 0, e.g any cells with a value greater than 1.  In the example below column Z is used and the values are contained in rows 13 to 38.  In a number of rows the sum of the value in column Z is 0.</p>
<p>The formula I have is =SUMPRODUCT(SMALL(Z$13:Z$38,{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}))/7</p>
<p>This works but only if, for example, the rows that return a 0 are either blank or contains a &quot;-&quot;.</p>
<p>This creates a problem as the rows have formula that are the sum of other cells in that row. For example Z20 has a formula that is the sum of M20 plus W20 which are the sum of D20:L20 &amp; N20:V20 respectively.  Although D20:L20 and N20:V20 are unpopulated the sum in M20 &amp; W20 both return a 0.  The cells D20:L20 &amp; N20:V20 will only be populated at a later date.</p>
<p>By entering a &quot;-&quot; or pressing delete to remove the 0 I also remove the formula. It then becomes necessary to re-enter the formula when populating the cells which is possible but not ideal due to the number of sheets involved and potential for error.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this problem?</p>

Both Win10 instances are booting and working fine, so I could be happy with the result.</p>

Instead, after a (short) while, it finally gets to the &quot;Windows 10 MUSIC&quot; login screen. From then on everything appears to be normal. So this is more a curiosity-type question:</p>
<p>is this just the normal / weird Windows way, or did something go wrong during the setup?</p>

<li>booted into Windows 10 MAIN and changed the &quot;display title&quot; for the future selection menu using bcdedit</li>
<li>rebooted to the setup image; created a fresh partition of ~150 GB, installed &quot;Windows 10 MUSIC&quot; to that partition</li>

It's visible under Device Manager as &quot;USB Mass Storage Device&quot;, and even Avast asks if I want to scan it for malware.  I can go to it by typing in &quot;E:&quot; in my file browser, but it is just completely blank with no files.</p>
<p>I cannot reformat it, as no actual program I've used detects its existence, and the USB stick is basically just...gone.  Even Rufus itself can no longer detect the USB stick, even with the &quot;List USB Hard Drives&quot; option.  And since there's no way to manually type in what drive to format in Rufus (or any other USB formatter that I've found), I am unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>Windows (my main machine runs 7) does not detect the stick through CMD's chkdsk, nor the file explorer, and if I force the system to recognize it by just going to &quot;E:&quot; manually (the drive disappears from the listings again when I click away from the drive), right clicking on the drive and selecting &quot;Format&quot; does nothing.  Windows doesn't even attempt it, the right click menu just closes.</p>
<p>I'm hoping Akeo sees this post, as I saw them answering other questions about their software.</p>

1607184,0,"<p>So, I discovered a strange quirk of the Windows 10 ping utility. If you ping a whole number instead of an IP address, it will &quot;convert&quot; that number to an IPv4 address. The conversion is such that the first octet is your 256^3 spot, second octet is 256^2, third is 256^1, and the last octet being the &quot;ones&quot; place or 256^0.</p>
<p>For example &quot;ping 200&quot; will ping 0.0.0.200, but &quot;ping 400&quot; will ping 0.0.1.144, where the &quot;1&quot; in the third octet represents 256 (256 + 144 = 400).</p>
<p>A quick Google search (although I couldn't think of a great search term) didn't bring anything.</p>
<p>My only two theories are this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It may be the case that in an earlier iteration of the IP schema (i.e. the unused v1, v2, or v3), the plan was to just use single whole numbers. Microsoft, in its' obsession with backwards compatibility wrote a translation algorithm into the ping utility to handle this way way back when ping was first coded.</li>
<li>It may be the case that due to the way the ping utility is coded, it normally takes a valid IPv4 address and translates it to a single whole number before doing something with that data. Thus, as a check in the code, if it sees that the user entered a single whole number, it just skips that initial translation step.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any ideas? It definitely intrigued my co-workers, but they were just as clueless as I am.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just tested it on my Arch Linux machine, and I can confirm that the behavior exists there as well, so that likely discredits my first theory.</p>

1607585,0,"<p>I have read in several places that you should avoid installing UEFI and BIOS OSes, even on different disks. Why?</p>
<p>I need to install a BIOS operating system, and also an UEFI OS, on the same PC. So I am thinking about doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all disks except one, install the BIOS OS on the disk</li>
<li>Remove all disks except one, install the UEFI OS on this other disk</li>
<li>Plugin all disks</li>
<li>Upon boot, I should be able to choose between the BIOS or UEFI disks via the boot menu, pressing F11.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should solve all problems? Or do I have to tinker with BIOS settings before booting a disk? What is the reason it is not recommended to install BIOS and UEFI OSes on different disks?</p>
<p>(For future reference; the reason you should not install UEFI and BIOS operating systems on one disk is this: BIOS OSes requires the disk be formatted MBR style. UEFI OSes requires the disk be formatted GPT style. So you have either a MBR disk or GPT disk, not both. So only one OS will work, the other will not. This is the reason you should not install BIOS and UEFI OSes on the same disk. However, if you install it on different disks, I think if it should work? If not, why?)</p>

1606328,0,"<p>I have a very quick question regarding the IO shield in my PC build. I'm a complete beginner when it comes to this, so this might be a silly question. I've recently started building a computer but I've hit a bit of an issue that's taken me around in circles.</p>
<p>The case I've got is a Obsidian 500D case and the motherboard I have is a MSI MPG Z490. I've installed the CPU, RAM and SSD on to the board no problem, but I've had an issue with screwing the board into the case itself.</p>
<p>The reason I bought the case was because it supported this motherboard (I used the site pcpartpicker.com to confirm this). When I go to place the motherboard in the case, the screw holes in the board don't fully align with the standoffs on the case. I've try wiggling the board around to try and see if I can align it, but to no avail.</p>
<p>But funnily enough, I removed the IO-shield from the motherboard (It came pre-attached to it) and tried again with aligning the board. And, it aligned perfectly. With no problems at all. My question is, is this normal? Surely it should just fit on without having to go through the need to remove the IO-shield? That's needed, right?</p>
<p>I've also tried taking the IO-shield off, placing it in the case, then attaching the motherboard but it doesn't align (like before). Although, the IO-shield doesn't snap into place when I put it in the case. After looking online most other builds I've seen have the IO-shield snap into place, so perhaps I'm being too gentle? One thing I did note was that the IO-shield seems to be a little too thin, i.e. it could be moved a little bit left and right in the slot (which I assume comes from it not being snapped into place?)</p>
<p>Thank you for the help in advance! :)</p>

1607050,13,"<p>As in previous versions of Windows, a user can change the screen resolution or the monitor setup in Windows 10 using the control panel. However, the dialog that asks for confirmation (&quot;Do you really want to change the screen resolution?&quot;) has a button with a timeout of approximately 15 seconds. If you do not press this button within the desired period of time, the changes will be reverted, probably in order to prevent the user from switching any resolution that their monitor setup does not support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this button is only accessible by mouse, or at least I fail to find a Shortcut (like Alt-y for &quot;yes&quot;), so the very simple question is:</p>

<p>I don’t want to upgrade to Windows 7. It isn’t worth the time and the laptop is a bit oldish for Windows 7.</p>
<p>Other than of spoofing OS and browser string components, how can it detect the spoof?</p>

P.S A grammer school  freak edited my question and verbiage. Hey Thanks but I did not begin my  question with  "" is it passive to ""  - now changed it. Keep the corrections lest there'd be your other competitors here  who 'll   score it down.
