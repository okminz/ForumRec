1606388,2,"<p>Apologies, but I am a bit confused by the wording of your question. However, in general, low-end consumer routers' &quot;DMZs&quot; typically place a given device &quot;outside&quot; your router's firewall settings (your router firewall settings no longer have any affect on the device). This has the advantage that you no longer need to set up ex. port forwarding. That said, it generally has the disadvantage that <em>all</em> incoming requests are sent to that device. So if there is a flaw in ex. the CCTV camera software, attackers may be able to gain access to the device or even potentially your network.</p>

1606494,1,"<p>There are a couple ways.</p>
<p>One way is to set all your Page Margins to 0 (if your printer cannot print all the way to the edge you will get a warning that it is outside the printable area), set the Table width to 100% or however many inches wide the page is, then set the row height to the height of the page (I like to set &quot;Row height is&quot; to &quot;Exactly&quot; instead of &quot;At least&quot; and also un-check &quot;Allow row to break across pages&quot; they're not necessary but may help). Now you should have a single cell table that fully covers the page. If you need multiple columns or rows you'll need to either split the table and figure out the measurements for each column and row to maintain full coverage or create a nested table.</p>
<p>Another way is to change the Table's Text Wrapping option to &quot;Around&quot; which (if you know HTML) is very similar to floating the table so you can &quot;break out&quot; of containers. Then click the &quot;Positioning...&quot; button and set them as shown in my attached image. The important settings on the Table Positioning are the &quot;Realitive to&quot; options, you want those set to &quot;Page&quot; and the distance all set to 0. Then same as the first method, set the Table width to the width of the page and the row height to the height of the page.</p>
<p>Note: It can be a little cumbersome getting the heights and widths just right especially when you start adding content and breaking up cells, but you can get it there adjusting the heights of the rows and widths of the table/columns. If you are planning to have this table as the only thing in your document, Word, for whatever reason, forces a new line at the end of the document. You may get stuck with a blank page at the end. I can sometimes get around that by setting the new line's paragraph settings to have no spacing and the smallest font possible and make my table height just a little less to allow the newline room on the first page.</p>

</ul>
<h2>In the Middle of a Document With Other Text</h2>
<p>If your table is in other text and you want to have normal margins for that other text, you will need to set your document up to have page SECTION breaks around it. This is done under the Layout Tab. Before your table: Breaks &gt; Next Page and after Breaks &gt; Next Page.</p>
<p>Then in the Headers and Footers Tab make sure your headers and footers are not &quot;Linked to Previous.&quot; Do this for both the header and footer. This should be done in the section that contains your table and the following section. Then make the changes to the headers and footers in the section that contains your table without changing others.</p>
<h2>Header and Footer Size - Do this after adding section breaks!</h2>
<p>While you cannot remove headers and footers in Word <em>(they are a part of the document structure)</em>, you can shrink them. This can be done in the Header/Footer Tab or in the Page Layout dialog. You can change the distance reserved to .1.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLoET.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLoET.png"" alt=""Controls on Header/Footer Tab"" /></a></p>
<p>Note that each header and footer has an <em>empty paragraph</em> in it. You can see these by displaying non-printing formatting marks. While you cannot delete those empty paragraphs, you can also shrink them. Go into each header and footer. Use Ctrl+A to select all text and then change the font size to 1 point. (You have to type the 1.)</p>
<p>Your header and footer may also have paragraph spacing set for space before or space after. This is paragraph formatting and can be changed in the Format Paragraph dialog that you can reach by clicking on the Dialog Launcher (little arrow in the bottom right of the Paragraph Group).</p>
<h2>Final Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any change in the Printer Driver being used changes the printable area. This may be different on different computers even if they are using the same printer.</li>
<li>Page numbering gets trickier with multiple sections. See my writing on <a href=""http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#PageNumbers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Page Numbering in Word</a>.</li>

<p>The reason is that in Windows 10, by default, support for the SMB v 1 protocol is disabled. And Windows XP uses this version of the protocol for network exchange.</p>
<p>The problem can be solved simply. You need to install the SMB v 1 component. To do this, you need to open the Windows 10 settings (via the Start menu), and there open the &quot;Applications and features&quot; settings group. In this group you need to find and open &quot;Programs and Features&quot;
In the list of programs, you need to open &quot;Turn on or off by Windows component&quot;.
In the list of components, you need to find and mark the components &quot;SMB Client and Server 1&quot;.
After installing the components, you need to check that the same Workgroup is specified in the computer names settings. And on a Windows 10 computer, disable password-protected sharing, unless of course you need to restrict access on your local network.</p>

<p>I suspect you may have mistaken the terminology. In your workflow you probably use two or more <em>clients</em> attached to <em>the same</em> session. I'm not aware of any method to turn the status line off for a particular client. I think you need more than one session.</p>
<p><sup>(Note: whenever this answer states a command starting with <code>tmux</code>, it's a command to be run in a shell. A command not starting with <code>tmux</code> is a command to run in tmux (after <kbd>prefix</kbd><kbd>:</kbd> or from a key binding). Usually you can convert one form to the other (or vice versa) by removing (or prepending) the <code>tmux</code> word.)</sup></p>
<p>There are at least two ways to get the same window in another session:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can share one or more windows between multiple sessions. Let's suppose there already is session <code>0</code> with a window <code>0:0</code>. Instead of attaching to the session <code>0</code> with another client (<code>tmux attach</code>), create a new session (<code>tmux new-session</code> or <code>tmux new</code> in short). Let's say the new session is <code>1</code>. Then you can <code>link-window</code> the old window to the new session:</p>
<pre><code>tmux link-window -s 0:0 -t 1:
</code></pre>
<p>A complementary command is <code>unlink-window</code>. Other windows can be created, linked or unlinked in each session independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can create a new session in the same session group. Instead of attaching to the session <code>0</code> with another client (<code>tmux attach</code>), create a new session like this:</p>
<pre><code>tmux new -t 0:
</code></pre>
<p>The new session will be denoted <code>0-1</code> or similar. Sessions in the same group share the same set of windows. New windows are linked to all sessions in the group and any windows closed removed from all sessions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please compare <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/1489266/432690"">this another answer of mine</a> posted under a question from a person who inadvertently did something like this.</p>
<p>One way or another now you have <em>two</em> sessions that share at least one window. You can <code>set status off</code> or <code>set status on</code> for each session independently. Doing it from a shell from within a shared window may target the wrong session, so either explicitly specify the session you want to affect:</p>
<pre><code>tmux set -t 0-1: status off
</code></pre>
<p>or don't do this via a shell, do this directly in tmux:</p>
<pre><kbd>prefix</kbd><kbd>:</kbd>set status off<kbd>Enter</kbd></pre>
<p>Possibly you will need just two sessions: one with a status line and one without. Remember you can name them (from the start with <code>new-session -s …</code> or later with <code>rename-session</code>). This way instead of <code>0:</code>, <code>1:</code> or <code>0-1:</code> you can use more descriptive custom names, e.g. <code>w</code> (like warriors: task- and timewarrior) and <code>w-noline</code>.</p>

<p>Your problem is that Windows goes through each entry in the PATH variable and checks if a binary of the name you're calling exists in there and aborts the search on the first match. Since your PATH variable contains the Python <code>Scripts</code> entries before the common Windows paths they'll override default commands since they contain a script called ping.</p>
<p>It's uncommon to add custom paths to the beginning of the PATH variable. You usually append to its end.</p>
<h2>How to fix:</h2>
<p>Take the list above and combine all entries with <code>;</code> as delimiter. But make sure to move the following entries to the end of the list:</p>

C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-11.0.3.7-hotspot\bin

<li>In the pop-up menu, click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>System Properties</strong> window, click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Environment Variables</strong>.</li>

1606795,2,"<p>Please read <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/30925/108618""><em>In Bash, when to alias, when to script, and when to write a function?</em></a></p>
<p>Alias is a purely textual replacement. Your alias injects so much code it would be more elegant if <code>myproject</code> was a function. This is a side &quot;issue&quot;. You can stick to the alias if you want.</p>
<p>The main issue is you're expecting <code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code> to work in the newly opened tab. When your alias replaces <code>myproject</code> with</p>
<pre><code>… gnome-terminal --tab --active &amp;&amp; cd ~/code/myproject-ember
</code></pre>
<p>and this code is executed, the fact that <code>gnome-terminal</code> is executed will not inject the next command (<code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code>) into a command line <em>there</em>. <code>cd</code> will be executed in the current shell after this particular <code>gnome-terminal</code> process exits successfully. The whole snippet is similar to:</p>
<pre><code>… true &amp;&amp; cd …
</code></pre>
<p>and there's no reason why this <code>cd</code> should be performed anywhere else than in the shell that executes the whole command.</p>
<p>Your attempt with <code>gnome-terminal --tab -e &quot;cd ~/code/myproject-ember&quot;</code> fails because:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> is never expanded. I understand the tilde is single-quoted when you define the alias. Then after the alias expansion it's <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/151850/108618"">double-quoted</a>. Then <code>gnome-terminal</code> receives the string <code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code>, splits it to words (without expanding the tilde) and tries to run the resulting command, but not in a shell (that could otherwise finally expand the tilde).</li>
<li>Running <code>cd</code> this way makes no sense. <code>cd …</code> is executed not in a shell; this requires a <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/38808/108618"">separate <code>cd</code> executable</a>, you may or may not have it in your OS. Even if you had it and even if the tilde was expanded, <code>gnome-terminal</code> would execute <code>cd</code> that would do its pointless job (change its own directory) and exit; and there would be nothing more to do in this tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>The right way to make <code>gnome-terminal</code> start an interactive shell in some directory is <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/75223/693277"">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>gnome-terminal --working-directory=/path/to/dir
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly as before, <code>gnome-terminal</code> won't expand <code>~</code> if it gets it after <code>--working-directory=</code>. Better use <code>$HOME</code> and and make sure it's expanded by your current shell. If you choose to use an alias, it may be:</p>
<pre><code>alias myproject='cd ~/code/myproject-rails &amp;&amp; rails s &amp; cd ~/code/myproject-ember &amp;&amp; ember s &amp; gnome-terminal --tab --active &quot;--working-directory=$HOME/code/myproject-ember&quot;'
</code></pre>
<p>In this case <code>$HOME</code> will be expanded after each alias expansion.</p>
<p>As I said, IMO a function would be more elegant:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>unalias myproject
myproject () {
   cd ~/code/myproject-rails &amp;&amp; rails s &amp;
   cd ~/code/myproject-ember &amp;&amp; ember s &amp;
   gnome-terminal --tab --active &quot;--working-directory=$HOME/code/myproject-ember&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note <code>rails</code> and <code>ember</code> will become jobs in the <em>old</em> shell. I don't know what they are but <em>maybe</em> you'd like to have them as jobs in the new shell. It can be done but I won't elaborate here. (If you need it and don't find a solution, ask a separate question.)</p>

<li>For the stream to &quot;start&quot; (i.e. the first output image to appear) the decoder needs to wait for the first full image (I-frame), on which the following B-frames and P-frames can be built. This is upper-bounded by the GOP length, which is typically in the 1-2 second range for streaming cameras. Since I-frames are most often not only scheduled at each GOP border, but also on significantly changed image content (&quot;oportunistic&quot; I-frames on scene change), it is very unlikely, that they come at the same time. This implies, that for a multi-input case, the minimum delay is the maximum time delta between I-frames in the different streams. <strong>Remember: A h.264 stream can by design not be interpreted from any given point in time on, but only from the first keyframe (I-frame) following that point in time</strong></li>

<p>I can go to a &quot;whatsmyip&quot; site and it correctly reports the external IP of my router</p>

<p>Sorry, that's not correct.  What you see is the translated address of your local devices.  That address is different than the IP address of the router interface.</p>
<p>When you browse the Internet, your router translates your internal, private IP of your PC (usually 192.168.0.x) to a public IP.  Your router remembers that translation for the duration of the browsing session -- when you leave the website, the translation is &quot;forgotten&quot; until you browse to a new site.</p>
<p>So if your girlfriend tries to ping your translated address, your router doesn't have the translation for your PC anymore.  So the ping is dropped.</p>
<p>What you need is a static translation for your Minecraft server.  Your ISP will give you one, if you ask -- and they will charge you for it.  then you would configure port forwarding on your router to translate the static IP to the address of the server.</p>

1606840,1,"<p>Well, it's hard to see the point of what you're doing with just this formula to look at.</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> it is taken as essentially your plan, with the exception of the error Excel reports, then you have the following concept in your formula:</p>
<p><em>IF some condition (N16=1 in this case) is TRUE, then report THIS (whatever &quot;THIS&quot; is) and if it is not TRUE, report THIS (whatever &quot;THIS&quot; is) ANYWAY.</em></p>
<p>That boils down to being the same as the following:</p>
<pre><code>=IF(A1=1,50,50)
</code></pre>
<p>The point being that if you get the same results for TRUE and for FALSE, then there's no point in the <code>IF()</code>. Note that there can be reasons external to the logic in the situation and, who knows, one of them may apply. Since you give no information meaningful to resolving THAT, one cannot say. But if none do, and that seems very likely, why use the <code>IF()</code> at all?</p>
<p>So only the result of either TRUE or FALSE matters here (since they are the same). You can simplify your formula by just using one of those portions of the formula.</p>
<p>That's if you want to &quot;simplify&quot; it. If you'd rather <strong>GREATLY simplify</strong> it, then consider what each test does. Your basic result in each test is to subtract 2 from some cell, then multiply it by the test cell. Cool. If that test cell is blank, Excel will consider it to be 0 and that multiplication will give you 0. So why bother testing whether it is blank if the reason to do so is to make the result 0? <em>Just the actual multiplication will do that for you without anything else needed.</em> If you drop the extra work, and the whole <code>IF()</code> idea, you get the following:</p>
<pre><code>=(2  *  C8*(D8-2)  -  C9*(D9-2)  -  C11*(D11-2)  +  C12*(D12-2)  )  /2
</code></pre>
<p>and since there seems to be no reason to multiply that by 2, then divide it by 2, take that out as well:</p>
<pre><code>=C8*(D8-2)  -  C9*(D9-2)  -  C11*(D11-2)  +  C12*(D12-2)
</code></pre>
<p>I'll take it that the expected &quot;C10*(D10-2)&quot; is not there for good reasons and go onward.</p>
<p>Stopping the simplifying at this point (since anyway, technically speaking, anything more happens to be &quot;streamlining&quot; more than &quot;simplifying&quot; in this case), I'd point out one huge advantage to using the above and not your formula:</p>
<p>It's so simple, and easy to type or generate, that silly entry errors should be hard to have happen, and should be extraordinarily easy to figure out if they do. Contrast that will your formula and the advantage should be easy to see.</p>
<p>That, and not the particular tricks of the trade above is the important part of this answer.</p>

<p>Your BIOS has tables which are evaluated by Linux during boot. Very often, those tables don't follow the ACPI standard, which nobody notices on Windows because the Vendor who wrote the tables also supply their own Windows driver which work with those tables.</p>
<p>However, there's no driver for Linux, so Linux has to somehow interpret even buggy tables.</p>
<p>The ACPI BIOS you are seeing may or may not be harmful, and may have been already present before the update. It also may be the cause of the hang.</p>
<p>The other error is more serios, the nvme device (SSD) failed during boot, which is probably the reason why the boot stops.</p>
<p>Ways to access the system:</p>

<p>The VPN Server receives the packet and modifies the source / destination ip address to point to the actual web server hosted on the same network.</p>

<p>This shouldn't ever be needed, because the client has already specified the destination IP address they want. (VPNs <em>encapsulate</em> the original packet inside another IP packet, without altering the original IP header, so the server only needs to decapsulate it again and forward the original packet exactly as it was.)</p>
<p>NAT can be done (and is occassionally done), but it's more often the OS firewall's job and the sysadmin's decision – it shouldn't be done by the VPN software all on its own.

1607538,0,"<p>Installing Gallium OS is well documented and I have added below a couple of useful
links. You will need to study well these articles, and the articles they link to,
before coming up with more questions.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing the boot media</strong></p>
<p>First, as there are different images for
<a href=""https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">different models of Chromebook</a>,
you need to choose the right one for your device.
In your case, the Acer c720 is marked in the &quot;Processor&quot; column as &quot;Intel Haswell&quot;.</p>
<p>Now you can download the
<a href=""https://galliumos.org/download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GalliumOS installation ISO image</a>
by clicking on the &quot;Haswell&quot; button.</p>
<p>Once you have the installation image, create a bootable USB drive with it.
The instructions for this are found on the GalliumOS website at
<a href=""https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Creating_Bootable_USB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Installing/Creating Bootable USB</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Backup before installation</strong></p>
<p>It is best to create a recovery image for your device in case something goes wrong
or if you decide that you want to go back to the current state.</p>
<p>You should create an image of your entire disk as backup, if you have enough
available disk media, for example by using Clonezilla.</p>
<p><strong>Installing GalliumOS</strong></p>
<p>Shut down the computer, plug in the USB drive containing the bootable
installation image, and restart, ensuring that the USB is used as the boot media.
The boot menu is entered from the BIOS by pressing
<kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>F2</kbd>, per your computer model.</p>
<p>The rest is a normal Linux installation, where the only difference is that you need
to re-format the entire disk as one partition.</p>

1607539,0,"<p>In your example <code>'curl … {}; printf &quot;%s %s\n&quot; &quot;$?&quot; '</code> (why the second <code>%s</code>?) is a single-quoted piece of shell code. In it you can use <code>{}</code> more than once:</p>
<pre><code>curl … {}; printf &quot;%s %s\n&quot; &quot;$?&quot; {}
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively create a variable and use it as many times as you want. The name of the variable can be descriptive, this is an advantage. There's another advantage: in general what gets substituted for <code>{}</code> can be a long string, substituting it many times may bloat the code <code>parallel</code> will pass to particular shells. IMO it's better to substitute once and let the shell save the string and reuse it:</p>
<pre><code>source_URL={}; curl … &quot;$source_URL&quot;; printf &quot;%s %s\n&quot; &quot;$?&quot; &quot;$source_URL&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><sup>In case of GNU <code>parallel</code> it's safe to embed <code>{}</code> in the shell code. It's an exception explicitly mentioned in this answer: <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/156010/108618""><em>Never embed <code>{}</code> in the shell code!</em></a>. You probably already know this, the remark is for a general audience.</sup></p>
<p>Note you need to adjust your <code>read</code> in the main loop, it now has to read into <em>four</em> variables. This way you will transfer the source URL from the inside of <code>parallel</code> to the main loop where you can compare it to <code>destination_url_var</code> or do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Still in this approach &quot;whatever you want&quot; is not parallelized.</p>
<p>If you capture the output from <code>curl</code> to separate variables inside the shell code run by <code>parallel</code> (instead of just printing it to be captured outside of <code>parallel</code>) then you will be able to do comparison (or whatever you want) <em>there</em>, in parallel. And e.g. <code>printf</code> <em>conditionally</em>. It's up to you where you implement the desired logic, as long as the inside of <code>parallel</code> generates output in the form expected by the outside <code>read</code>.</p>
<p>The shell code passed to <code>parallel</code> still needs to be single-quoted. As it grows, you may need to use (embed) single-quotes in this very code; then quoting will get somewhat complicated and less readable. In such situation consider moving the code to a separate script where you can quote independently. You will invoke it from the main script like this:</p>
<pre><code>while read … ; done &lt; &lt;( … | parallel -j 20 -k 'path/to/separate_script {}' )
</code></pre>
<p>Inside the <code>separate_script</code> the string substituted for <code>{}</code> will be available as <code>$1</code> (don't forget to <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/131767/108618"">double-quote it</a>).</p>
