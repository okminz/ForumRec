If it will not power even if the disks are not connected, then it cannot be the operating system, just a coincidence which threw us off on a wrong track!</p>
<p>To validate, unplug everything inside the case until you have just the motherboard and PSU. Power on and see what happens. If it powers on, add a screen and GPU if there is no builtin graphics, check again. Repeat until it no longer powers on to find the culprit.</p>
<p>If it does not power on at all even just the PSU and MB, it's could be either. You'll have to replace one so try to borrow a PSU to see it is can run the MB but it's possible the motherboard just died.</p>

<p>The case I've got is an Obsidian 500D case and the motherboard I have is an MSI MPG Z490. I've installed the CPU, RAM, and SSD on the board with no problem, but I've had an issue with screwing the board into the case itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case claims it supports MATX, ATX, and ITX.  The motherboard you purchase is an ATX board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason I bought the case was that it supported this motherboard (I used the site pcpartpicker.com to confirm this). When I go to place the motherboard in the case, the screw holes in the board don't fully align with the standoffs on the case. I've tried wiggling the board around to try and see if I can align it, but to no avail.</p>

<p>You are aware that particular website isn't 100% accurate right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But funnily enough, I removed the IO-shield from the motherboard (It came pre-attached to it) and tried again with aligning the board. And, it aligned perfectly. With no problems at all. My question is, is this normal? Surely it should just fit on without having to go through the need to remove the IO-shield? That's needed, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's supposed to be tight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've also tried taking the IO-shield off, placing it in the case, then attaching the motherboard but it doesn't align (like before). Although, the IO-shield doesn't snap into place when I put it in the case. After looking online most other builds I've seen have the IO-shield snap into place, so perhaps I'm being too gentle? One thing I did note was that the IO-shield seems to be a little too thin, i.e. it could be moved a little bit left and right in the slot (which I assume comes from it not being snapped into place?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It shouldn't be necessary but what you describe seems to be common with this particular case.  Since the I/O shield is typically just snapped into place, the fact the I/O shield is screwed in, it looks like it was intentionally designed to be removed.</p>

<p>Why I can't access my Raspberry Pi webserver over the internet?</p>

<p>At a guess, because you haven't set up the NUC web server to be a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reverse proxy</a> (i.e. to forward web requests, based on your Dynamic DNS domain for the Raspberry Pi, to your Raspberry Pi itself).</p>
<p>Typically, only one web server can be associated with an IP address at a time (independent of Dynamic DNS names). So when an external request (e.g. 4G) for ex.<code> mypi.noip.com</code> is received by your NUC, it likely simply drops it. You need to explicitly tell the NUC web server software to pass requests for ex.<code> mypi.noip.com</code> to the Raspberry Pi on your local network. The NUC would then return any messages from the Raspberry Pi (e.g. a web page) to any external client.</p>

1606514,0,"<h3>Preliminary notes</h3>
<p>Nowadays <code>sh</code> is <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/98912/108618"">not necessarily the legacy Bourne shell</a>. Nowadays <code>sh</code> is a shell that supports <em>at least</em> the features required by POSIX (assuming a correct implementation). POSIX specifies the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sh</code> utility</a> and the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/shell.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shell Command Language</a>.</p>
<p>I assume you want your code to work in a POSIX shell and to be portable in general.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p><a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/278465/108618""><code>dd ibs=1 count=…</code> is a POSIX way to read an exact number of bytes</a>. It seems to be the only portable command line utility that can do the job reliably. But <code>dd</code> reads bytes, while <code>read -n</code> in Bash reads <em>characters</em>. <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html#tag_06_02"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">POSIX allows multi-byte characters in locales other than <code>POSIX</code></a>. Even if you run the entire script with <code>LC_ALL=POSIX</code>, the terminal (terminal emulator) may still generate a multi-byte sequence upon some single keystroke. Such sequence may not be a multi-byte character; it may be an escape sequence (<a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/211923/108618"">e.g. for <kbd>F1</kbd></a>, also see <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/116630/108618"">this answer</a>).</p>
<p>After you read just one byte, the rest will remain and it will be read by anything that tries to read from the terminal later (it may be a part of your script or the interactive shell you run the script from).</p>
<p>Additionally if you run sole <code>dd ibs=1 count=1</code> then you will most likely discover that nothing gets to <code>dd</code> until you exceed <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html#tag_11_01_05"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>{MAX_INPUT}</code> or <code>{MAX_CANON}</code></a>, or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/110248/108618""><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd></a> (and in case of <code>count</code> being more than <code>1</code>, if you want to provide less bytes then you may need to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/21261742/10765659"">twice</a>).</p>
<p>To deal with these issues you need the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html#tag_11_01_07"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-canonical mode</a>. Use <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/stty.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>stty -icanon</code></a>. In general starting with <code>stty raw</code> looks like a good idea.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The following example is a proof of concept. Because it manipulates line settings of the terminal and reads from the terminal <strong>you <em>must not</em> paste it into an interactive shell, this won't work</strong>. Paste it into a file and run the file.</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/sh

echo &quot;Press any key to continue.&quot;

saveterm=&quot;$(stty -g)&quot;                     # save terminal state
stty raw
stty -echo -icanon min 1 time 0           # prepare to read one byte
dd ibs=1 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null   # read one byte
stty -icanon min 0 time 0                 # prepare to read lefotvers
while read none; do :; done               # read leftovers
stty $saveterm                            # restore terminal state
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The script doesn't check if its stdin is a terminal, but in general it should (<a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/401938/108618""><code>[ -t 0 ]</code></a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a sane setup a modifier key (e.g. <kbd>Shift</kbd>), when pressed alone, sends no input to whatever reads from the terminal; therefore our code will not register such key as &quot;any key&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;read leftovers&quot; trick is taken from <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/1268886/432690"">this answer</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thanks to <code>stty raw</code> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> can be &quot;any key&quot; as well, instead of sending <code>SIGINT</code> or <code>SIGSTOP</code> respectively. Still the shell interpreting the script may get a signal from elsewhere, so in general it may happen it exits before it gets to <code>stty $saveterm</code>; so it may happen it leaves the terminal in a state not suitable for interactive use. You may want to trap relevant signals and restore the initial state of the terminal anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's true <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/131767/108618"">one should double-quote variables</a> in general. Here <code>$saveterm</code> is deliberately not quoted because <code>stty -g</code> generates output that is unspecified. Implementations of <code>stty</code> are allowed to generate output with spaces and later expect the shell to split it and pass multiple arguments. What is specified is a constraint that the output of <code>stty -g</code> must be safe when unquoted, it must not trigger word expansion in a shell. For portability unquoted <code>$saveterm</code> is better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To know what byte was read you need to save the output of <code>dd</code>, either to a regular file (<code>&gt;some_file</code>) that you will examine later, or to a variable (<code>variable=&quot;$(dd …)&quot;</code>). But:</p>
<ul>
<li>A terminal is able to generate a null byte (commonly with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd>) but most (all?) implementations of <code>sh</code> cannot store a null byte in a variable. Storing in a file is OK, if only you can examine/manipulate its content without reading it into a variable.</li>
<li><code>dd</code> from the above code will give you only one byte, it may not be enough to tell the character or the key. OTOH a single byte should be enough to tell apart e.g. <kbd>Q</kbd> from anything else, so <code>Press Q to quit or any other key to continue.</code> or <code>P - proceed; B - back; Q - quit; H - help</code> seem possible to implement without analyzing more bytes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>What about more bytes?</h3>
<p>The above should be fine for &quot;press any key&quot;. A real equivalent of <code>read -n</code> should read one byte at a time and decode the sequence until it gets the desired number of <em>characters</em>. I'm not going to try to build it here.</p>

<ol>

Once it's enabled, set the microphone in discord/skype/telegram to &quot;stereo mix.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: no additional software, quick setup, free.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Can't talk at the same time, and other people in discord will be able to hear themselves. Have to change to and from the <code>stereo mix</code> device everytime you want to start/stop sharing your audio.</p>

There are a few different options out there, but they mostly all work the same, and this one is free: <a href=""https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm</a> To use this, set the <code>Line 1 (VB-Audio Cable)</code> as your microphone in discord, and then go to the <code>Stereo Mix</code> device properties and check the box <code>listen to this device</code> and set it to the virtual cable:

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Minimal software, relatively simple setup, You can talk at the same time, less fiddling need to turn it 'on' or 'off'<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Other discord users will be able to hear themselves, still requires you go into windows sound control panel to turn it 'on/off'</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Use <a href=""https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Voicemeeter</a>. (same developer of the virtual audio cable I included above). There are many setup videos for voicemeeter, setting it up to do exactly what you want without discord users being able to hear themselves.

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Incredibly flexible, Share arbitrary audio, audio effects, can be used for more than just sharing your audio, discord users can't hear themselves, very scalable free.
<strong>Cons</strong>: Your audio setup is now reliant on voicemeeter (at least it's free), moderately complicated, it's easy to mess up the configuration.</p>

<p>What is odd in your case is the disparity between two kernels for each Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS install. One is <code>5.3.0-1039-gke</code> and the other is <code>4.15.0-124-generic</code>. This is what I know:</p>

<p>While your post implies both machines are 100% the same, my personal feeling is something is different between the two of them. Perhaps the motherboards or BIOS’s are different? That is the only rational explanation I can see for why there is such a wide disparity between kernel versions here.</p>

1606629,0,"<p>Well, first of all, I hope that the steps you describe hardly point to Rufus having rendered your USB inoperable.</p>
<p>Up to the point where you replugged the drive back onto your original machine, there was nothing wrong with it, since it had been properly detected then, and, as you should be able to tell, there's simply no way Rufus could have &quot;magically&quot; rendered your drive inoperable between the time you unplugged the drive from the computer you planned to boot it on and plugged it back on the computer you created the drive with (The message you saw when you tried to boot the USB is a simple text output produced by invoking basic BIOS functions, and not some kind of fancy executable that's accessing the USB. As a matter of fact, the <a href=""https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/blob/master/res/mbr/msg.S"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">code to display that message</a> requires no knowledge of USB, and even if it was buggy and wrote garbage data all over the drive —not a small feat considering that the code is designed to simply invoke BIOS calls to <strong>read</strong> and display data— you would just end up with an unpartitioned drive that any application could repartition and reformat since this would not, in any way, make the drive undetectable).</p>
<p>So, by the looks of it, your flash drive simply <strong>failed</strong> when you plugged it back on that other computer, and <a href=""https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/FAQ#Help_Rufus_damaged_my_flash_drive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rufus had nothing whatsoever to do with that</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, if it's not detected any longer on any of your computers, then there's nothing any software can do to salvage it. Your drive is dead and you will just have to replace it.</p>
<p>What I usually recommend, as a last resort, is to see if your drive is recognized at all on a non Windows machine (e.g. Linux). But considering that your drive can't be listed in Rufus any longer, it is most likely dead.</p>

1606889,0,"<p>Because I ended up needing to pipe my files through a lot of different Bash tools like <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>wc</code> and <code>tr</code>, I decided it was safer to go for the &quot;proper solution&quot; indicated in the accepted answer; converting them all to UTF-8 first. This ended up being a little harder than expected, not least because it took me a while to realise that <code>file</code> isn't reliable at determining whether a file is ASCII or UTF-8 (because it doesn't check the whole of the file), so I'm putting this answer up here for posterity.</p>
<p>To definitively determine what encoding your files are in, first make sure the <code>uchardet</code> package is installed via the Cygwin Installer or <a href=""https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apt-cyg</a>, then run:</p>
<pre><code>uchardet *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you're not on Cygwin:</p>
<pre><code>chardet *.txt 
</code></pre>
<p>Move all of the files that <code>chardet</code> lists as <code>ASCII</code> to a folder of their own, and run the following <code>for</code> loop in that folder:</p>
<pre><code>for i in *.txt; do iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-8 &quot;$i&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;${i%.txt}_utf.txt&quot;; done;
</code></pre>
<p>It will loop through all <code>.txt</code> files in a folder and create UTF-8 versions of them with the <code>utf</code> suffix added.</p>
<p>Running <code>uchardet *.txt</code> again may still show some files as being <code>ASCII</code>. This happens because ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36030982/1191147"">simply means</a> that those files don't contain characters outside the ASCII range of 128 bits.</p>
<p>You should now be able to run <code>sort</code> without needing to use <code>LC_ALL=C</code>.</p>

Meet Now is useful to a subset of users. If you don't plan to use it, you may want to remove it from the taskbar as it takes up space without providing anything of use to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple options are available to remove Meet Now from the system. One of the easier options involves right-clicking on the Meet Now icon and selecting &quot;hide&quot; from the context menu that opens. Doing so removes the Meet Now icon from the Windows 10 taskbar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another option that you have is to open the Settings application on the system, e.g. by using the shortcut Windows-I, or by selecting Start &gt; Settings, going to Personalization &gt; Taskbar, selecting &quot;turn system icons on or off&quot;, and toggling &quot;Meet Now&quot; on the page that opens to off. You may restore Meet Now at anytime using the Settings app, but need to make sure the feature is set to on this time.</p>

1607129,0,"<p>I've edited the title of your question, because standard delete refers to deleting a file which is less worse than a format. However, deleting a partition is worse than a format.</p>
<p>The difference is:</p>
<p>You have an allocated space called partition, and you can format that in different layouts. Format clears the partition, but delete partition removes the partition alltogether, turning it into unallocated space. If you delete multiple partitions, the new unallocated space will not be segmented. If you want to restore the partition, you have to recreate it. If you want it to be the same size as it was, then it helps to know what it was.</p>
<p>Recovering a formatted drive is easier than recovering a deleted partition. Most software can recover a formatted drive if you don't do anything with it since the format, but a deleted partition may require special tools and skills.</p>
<p>Deleting just one partition, and recreating it is not that hard though.</p>
<p>That said, you are in the Windows Setup screen, and if you go for either format or delete, it seems you do not have any sensitive data on the disk anyway. If you are considering repartitioning the entire drive to make windows use all of the space, the easiest trick is to delete all partitions, and then select the unallocated empty space and just install to that. Windows setup will then create 4 partitions. 1 big partition for your C and 3 for recovery purposes. That is the best practice, but it means you have to have backups before doing this, as the drives will be empty afterwards.</p>

1607149,1,"<p>If all you did was really just deleting partitions, you are in luck. Deleting a single partition is trivial to fix, just re-create it in place. Not with Windows tools though, they are too high-level. Instead, use Linux tools like <code>fdisk</code>. Fundamentally, a partition is just an entry in a table with start and end points (and some other stuff).</p>
<p>Restoring multiple partitions is harder (unless you remember sizes down to the byte), but still very much possible if they contained popular filesystems (like NTFS, FAT32, ext2/3/4, …). <a href=""https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Testdisk</a> can find many types of popular filesystems. This works by scanning the likely areas or the whole disk (so it can take a very long time) to discover the beginning of filesystems. Most filesystems record in their metadata their size, further easing recovery.</p>
<p>Backing up your drive prior to any recovery attempt is prudent. However, most “consumer” image software will only operate on partitions, not drives. Instead, use <code>dd</code> (a Linux/Unix tool) to create a full exact copy of the drive. This requires as much space as the drive has. <code>dd</code> is very easy to use.</p>
<p>First, use <code>fdisk</code> to identify the drive to back up:</p>

<p>Here, <code>/dev/md1</code> does not have any partitions. It could be your source drive!</p>
<p>Then, create a backup: <code>dd if=/dev/md1 of=/path/to/image.img bs=1M status=progress</code> (If your version of <code>dd</code> does not support <code>status=progress</code>, you can just remove it. You won’t see anything while <code>dd</code> is running then though.)</p>
<p>You can create the backup anywhere. If you have another drive that is the exact same size as the source, you can also clone the drive (somewhat like <code>dd if=/dev/md1 of=/dev/sdx …</code>), but take extra care not to accidentally overwrite the wrong drive! If you have another storage location with enough free space, you can just store the backup in a file (as described above).</p>
<p>You can use virtually any live Linux (Ubuntu, …) because they all contain tools like <code>dd</code> and <code>fdisk</code>. You’ll have to download Testdisk, but that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: You mention the partitions were encrypted using VeraCrypt. This makes recovery very difficult. Testdisk cannot find partition boundaries with VeraCrypt, only with older TrueCrypt volumes. You’ll have to do everything by hand.</p>
<p>You have to guess where the first partition started (maybe at sector 2048). Create a single partition spanning the entire drive. You may then be able to mount it using VeraCrypt (preferably read-only) and, if successful, you might be able to determine the partition size. If not, try elsewhere.</p>
<p>With the partition size in hand you would then have a rough position of where the second partition starts. Repeat the same process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other address representations were in common use when classful networking was practiced. For example, the loopback address 127.0.0.1 is commonly written as 127.1, given that it belongs to a class-A network with eight bits for the network mask and 24 bits for the host number. When fewer than four numbers are specified in the address in dotted notation, the last value is treated as an integer of as many bytes as are required to fill out the address to four octets. Thus, the address 127.65530 is equivalent to 127.0.255.250.</p>

1607226,0,"<p>IPv4 addresses are unsigned 32-bit integers. In a misguided attempt to make them more human-readable, they are traditionally displayed in the UI in &quot;dotted decimal&quot; notation, where each octet (8-bit byte), starting with the most significant, is represented as a decimal number, separated from the next octet by a dot.</p>

1607231,0,"<p><strong>&quot;.0&quot; can be omitted conditionally</strong></p>
<p>You often use the &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; command to do a loop test on the machine to verify whether the TCP/IP protocol suite of the machine is correctly installed. But did you find it? The same test result can be obtained by using the command &quot;ping 127.1&quot;. In fact, the two commands &quot;ping 127.1&quot; and &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; are the same, both of which are performing loop tests.</p>
<p>Why is this so? This is the skill of using IP address in Ping command application. Everyone knows that the IP address is composed of 32 binary digits. In order to make it easier for everyone to remember, every 8 binary digits are converted into decimal digits. Therefore, an easy-to-remember IP address consisting of four-part decimal digits (such as 127.0.0.1 ). Since the Windows operating system has the function of automatically filling &quot;.0&quot;, I can change &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; to &quot;127.1&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the omission of this &quot;.0&quot; is conditionally restricted and cannot be omitted arbitrarily. In the application of the Ping command, you can only omit one or more &quot;.0&quot;s that appear before the last decimal number of the IP address, such as rewriting the &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; command to &quot;ping 127.1&quot;.</p>
<p>If the one or more &quot;.0&quot; is not next to the last part of the decimal number, but in other positions, then this &quot;.0&quot; cannot be omitted, such as &quot;ping 202.0.96.1&quot; cannot be written as &quot;ping 202.96.1&quot; &quot;. This is because the result returned by &quot;ping 202.96.1&quot; is the response message of &quot;202.96.0.1&quot; instead of the response message of &quot;202.0.96.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Number string instead of IP address</strong></p>
<p>In the Ping command, you can also use a numeric string instead of an IP address. Run the &quot;ping 3658906394&quot; command, and you will see the return information of the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot;.</p>
<p>Why is this so? In fact, &quot;3658906394&quot; is another representation of the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot;. Of course, you can also ping other IP addresses in the same way.</p>
<p>How is the string converted? In fact, it is not complicated. Taking the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; as an example, the method of converting the IP address into a numeric string is as follows: first convert &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; to hexadecimal &quot;DA.16.7B.1A&quot;, and then remove it. After the decimal point, it becomes &quot;DA167B1A&quot;, and finally the hexadecimal number is converted to decimal &quot;3658906394&quot;, then &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; becomes &quot;3658906394&quot;. The same method is used to convert other IP addresses into numeric strings.</p>
<p>Tip: In some LAN environments, using the &quot;Ping+number string&quot; command may fail, and the prompt message &quot;Unknown host number string&quot; appears. This is because the number string is resolved into a host name instead of an IP address.</p>

1607372,8,"<p>No, for two main reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intel and AMD CPUs in desktop and laptop computers, if properly installed, cooled, not overclocked, and not subject to electrical problems like a bad power supply, will last a very long time even if all cores are constantly 100% utilized--such that you don't usually have to worry about &quot;wearing out&quot; your CPU.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore, even from the first PC's of the early 80's, disk drives used something called Direct Memory Access (DMA).  Floppy drives have used DMA since the first PC, and hard drives started to have DMA modes probably sometime in the late 80's.</p>
<p>DMA basically allows drives to transfer data to and from RAM without the CPU in the middle.  So hard drive transfers have even less of a CPU impact than you might think.</p>
<p>Where the CPU might still be in the middle is if you have disk encryption running on your system, such as Bitlocker, TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt, or other.  But it's still not going to be anything to worry about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are causing an HDD hard drive (not an SSD) to work harder by copying from it constantly.  You are adding wear to an SDD by copying <em>to</em> it.  Spinning-rust HDDs and even SSDs do have a finite lifetime that is likely less than your CPU.</p>
<p>TL;DR - you should be much more worried about the lifetime of your drives (and have backups/multiple copies) than the CPU.</p>
",51705,1607367
1607375,4,"<p><strong>Damage to CPU - Minimal, if any</strong></p>
<p>1a. CPUs are not heavily involved in file copies - The CPU's job is to tell the other hardware to do the transfer, and the actual transfer of 1's and 0's is left to other chipsets/IO's to do.</p>
<p>1b. Even if a file transfer did use a lot of CPU, CPUs have incredibly good longevity and usually processors don't fail or go bad - they <em>do</em> get replaced regularly due to being outdated - which speaks to the fact of its longevity - a CPU will outlive its efficiency lifespan.</p>
<p><strong>Damage to HDD - Still minimal, but worth considering</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using an HDD wears an HDD. It has moving parts, so the more they're used, the more potential for damage from wear - but if you can't use it it's useless anyway. The best practice for HDDs is to know that at some point, it <strong>will</strong> fail and to have backups - this is the only real protection you have against HDD failure - backups.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You <em>can</em> reduce the wear and tear on the HDD by ensuring that you run a single copy command at any given time (which is what I suspect is the typical method), so whether you do a drag &amp; drop or a command line like <code>robocopy</code>, make sure you only do one of this actions and let it complete before starting another one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Your specific questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>No, you will not affect your CPU in a negative way, in fact you can open task manager during this and probably witness your CPU not go over 20% usage, depending on what else your computer is doing in the background.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No, all CPUs are built to be robust - a 3rd gen i7 vs an 8th gen i9, or a Ryzen7, what have you, is engineered to last and endure utilization far above what a file transfer will do to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No, this would not be a helpful method to reduce the damage that we've already stated is negligible. Even if your CPU isn't properly cooled, this low utilization should not make it overheat - and if it does, its performance will only be affected while it's too hot - its lifetime performance/longevity will not be affected by overheating.</p>

Instead, it is recommended to create a folder in the root of C and use that instead.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if this will affect my cpu long term in ANY way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Everything</strong> will affect your CPU life in <strong>SOME</strong> way.</p>
<p>It is just that many things (like your copying data from one HDD to another) do so in such a minuscule way, it is not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>So yes, your use of CPU for few hours will shorten it's life by few hours.
You would also shorten it's life for few hours if it was showing screensaver for few hours, instead of copying your data. And even if computer was turned off, the CPU (and other components) would age (albeit at a usually much slower rate).</p>
<p>So to answer your question: <strong>It doesn't matter</strong> as the effect is incredibly small. Just copy the things you need to copy.</p>
<p>Anyway, the rest of your computer system (like motherboard and aforementioned HDDs) will very likely die much sooner than your CPU, leaving your computer useless.
And probably, even before that motherboard and disks die, your computer will be so obsolete that you will not be using it even if it was still functional (like, find a few decades years old computer in museum and try to make it do such a simple task as browsing this web site)</p>

1607656,0,"<p>When you try to run <code>rm *.bar</code> and there is no file that matches <code>*.bar</code>, basically two things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The POSIX behavior is the shell runs <code>rm</code> with literal <code>*.bar</code> as an argument. The tool tries to remove a file literally named <code>*.bar</code> (as if you run <code>rm '*.bar'</code>), it fails and prints something like <code>rm: *.bar: No such file or directory</code>. This is how the POSIX shell (<code>sh</code>) and compatible shells behave.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-POSIX behavior is the shell detects there is no match, prints something like <code>no matches found: *.bar</code> and doesn't run <code>rm</code> <em>at all</em>. This is how Zsh behaves by default. (For comparison: in Bash you can switch to this behavior by <code>shopt -s failglob</code>.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An error from <code>rm</code> (the former case) is printed to the stderr of <code>rm</code>. An error from the shell (the latter case) is printed to the stderr of the shell.</p>
<p>The redirection in <code>rm *.bar 2&gt;/dev/null</code> affects the stderr of <code>rm</code> only<sup>+</sup>. In your example <code>rm</code> doesn't even run.</p>
<p>To redirect the stderr of the shell you need <code>exec</code>. Example:</p>
<pre><code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>In Zsh you can even close it:</p>
<pre><code>exec 2&gt;&amp;-
</code></pre>
<p>A reasonable approach is to duplicate the original stderr beforehand, just in case you need to use (or restore) it later. Example (note if you want to paste this code into an interactive Zsh then you should invoke <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/557490/108618""><code>setopt interactive_comments</code></a> first):</p>
<pre class=""lang-bsh prettyprint-override""><code>exec 7&gt;&amp;2           # &quot;save&quot; stderr
exec 2&gt;/dev/null    # redirect
rm *.bar
whatever
exec 2&gt;&amp;7           # restore
exec 7&gt;&amp;-           # close descriptor which is no longer needed
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>7</code> is an arbitrary single-digit number, otherwise unused as a file descriptor. The first two lines can be written as one: <code>exec 7&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;/dev/null</code>; similarly the last two lines can.</p>
<p>Note <code>rm</code> or any command (like <code>whatever</code>) invoked without stderr redirection inherits stderr from the shell. This means in the above example <code>rm</code> (if it ever runs) and <code>whatever</code> will print their error messages (if any) to <code>/dev/null</code>. After <code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null</code> you can invoke any number or commands and they all will have <code>/dev/null</code> as their stderr. If you really want to suppress all kinds of error messages then this is the way.</p>
<p>The solution works in many shells, not only in Zsh. If you want to redirect stderr of an interactive shell then keep in mind some less sophisticated shells use stderr to print their prompt.</p>
<p>Note a process may redirect its own stderr (like our shell does with <code>exec 2&gt;…</code>); or it can print error messages to stdout or to <code>/dev/tty</code> (it shouldn't, but it technically can). Therefore <code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null</code> does <em>not</em> guarantee you will see no messages that look like error messages.</p>
<p>After <code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null</code> you still can redirect stderr of any command on demand. E.g. if instead <code>whatever</code> we had:</p>
<pre><code>whatever 2&gt;&amp;7
</code></pre>
<p>then its error messages would go to the original stderr we deliberately saved as file descriptor <code>7</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>+</sup> Strictly: it affects &quot;<code>rm</code>&quot; before and after it becomes (or tries to become) <code>rm</code>. Bear with me. The redirection in <code>rm … 2&gt;/dev/null</code> starts as a redirection performed by a <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/31118/108618"">forked shell that is about to replace itself with <code>rm</code> executable</a>. This shell redirects its own stderr before it tries to replace itself with <code>rm</code>. Any error it reports after performing the redirection will go to <code>/dev/null</code>. E.g. if <code>rm</code> is not to be found then the already performed redirection will suppress the <code>command not found</code> error.</p>

1607659,0,"<p>Your <code>awk</code> command properly keeps <code>valueA:valueB</code> and <code>valueD:valueE</code> example lines, and it removes the <code>valueC:</code> line (therefore I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;seems to match <em>everything</em>&quot;).</p>
<p>The command keeps <code>:valueG</code> because you don't test the first field at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't print lines where any of two columns is empty&quot; can be coded in <code>awk</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>awk -F : '! ( $1==&quot;&quot; || $2==&quot;&quot; )'
</code></pre>
<p>The task is equivalent to &quot;print only lines where each column is non-empty&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>awk -F : '$1!=&quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; $2!=&quot;&quot;'
</code></pre>
<p>Note <code>awk</code> is a tool very well suited to deal with the problem. Our two lines reflect the desired logic in terms of &quot;delimiter&quot; (<code>-F :</code>), &quot;columns&quot;/&quot;fields&quot; (<code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>) &quot;being empty&quot; (<code>…==&quot;&quot;</code>) etc. There may be solutions with other tools, but their operation won't necessarily express the logic so clearly. E.g. with <code>grep</code>:</p>
<pre><code>grep '.:.'
</code></pre>
<p>The above command works fine and it's simpler than the <code>awk</code> ones. Its form doesn't directly reflect the gist of the problem though. While its minimalism pleases me aesthetically, I still think <code>awk</code> is the Right Thing.</p>
