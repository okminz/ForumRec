1,1,"<p>If you've got sensitive information you need to recover on it, I'd suggest a repair business with a clean room environment, because this would be the only way to ""open it up and see what's stuck (mechanically) inside"".</p>

<p>Those services are sort of expensive (usually $100+/workhour in a clean room, plus additional costs of e.g. donor parts or for more difficult problems (disk encryption etc.)). Keep in mind, that they usually WON'T CHARGE anything if they can't recover your data, but since this seems to be a mechanical fault, maybe inside the drive motor or HSA (head stack assembly) motor, I am quite confident that a mechanic could fix it.</p>

<p>The behaviour you observed is not uncommon - due to changing environmental factors (mainly temperature), devices you thought were dead will ""magically"" work again. But as a hard drive contains spinning parts, generating vibrational forces, a possible loose connection could get torn apart again after a few minutes running.</p>

3,1,"<p>We cannot write the script for you, but I can help outline the steps and programming logic I would recommend.  </p>

<p>First, you presumably have the /path/to/studentsnumbers/ where you are finding the folder structure you list above.  Store that in a variable here we will call PathToStudNumbs.  </p>

<pre><code>PathToStudNumbs=""/path/to/studentsnumbers/"" 
</code></pre>

<p>Next there are a couple of useful tools you will want to explore:  basename and dirname.  These will obtain information about the elements of a path to a specific file.  You may not need these for this case because all of the files you are changing are apparently named the same (coursework).  </p>

<p>Since we don't know how you are iterating over your directories, I leave it to you to sort out what use basename and dirname will be to your specific situation.  </p>

<p>Let's reframe how we see the current paths.  We can rework that to something containing the elements we care about using variables.  (I assume below the coursework number also changes over time.)  </p>

<pre><code>""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/coursework.thy""  
</code></pre>

<p>If you work this into a cp statement to a different directory, it would look something like this:  </p>

<pre><code>cp ""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/coursework.thy"" ""${PathToDestination}/${StudNumbs}_${courseworkNumb}.thy"" 
</code></pre>

<p>This would make a copy of the target file in a folder of your choosing where the new file would be named something like 123456_coursework1.thy (which is to say the student number, an underscore, the coursework number, and the file extension).  </p>

<p>Or you could rename the existing file in place with mv, something like this:  </p>

<pre><code>mv ""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/coursework.thy"" ""${PathToStudNumbs}/${StudNumbs}/${courseworkNumb}/${StudNumbs}_${courseworkNumb}.thy""

0,1,"<p>Of course it will just fit in (thanks to ATX-standards), because the 8-Pin EPS-variant on your motherboard is just 2x 4-Pin (but mirrored).<br>
Using only one 4-Pin connector halves the amount of +12V and GND pins to two (Instead four)
Despite your PSU featuring only single rail +12V, it really won't make that much difference if you use the 4-Pin connector only. The Core i7 8700k has a TDP of 95W (according to Intel) which the two +12V cables a 4-Pin connector features can handle. If you take a total of ~4 Amps per line (95W / (12V x 2)), that should work.
Suggest to just test if the PC will boot at all and than do a stress test of > 30 Min while you watch for smoke etc.  </p>

<p>If the pronoun sets are not filled on completing the form, they should default based on the filling of the gender option by a simple autofill function.</p>

<p>You can then pull these boxes just like any other data attached to the address card from the database.</p>

<p>The use of these fields not only eliminates unneeded runtime macros to select pronouns, but also permits the freefilling of forms for non-standard situations.   </p>
