<p>Normaly I would just delete the manjaro partitions and extend windows over the unnalocated space, however somehow there are two partitions (a recovery partition and the EFI partition) between windows and what would be the unalocated space (<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZucx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">print from diskmanager tool, sorry for the typo on EFI</a>)</p>

<pre><code>(bash)
ffmpeg -i foo.mp3 -f wav - | opusenc --bitrate 64 - bar.opus

<p>This is neat, because it means you don't have to write the WAV data to disk before passing it to opus, so the encoding happens on the fly in memory instead.</p>
<p>I have both <code>ffmpeg</code> and <code>opusenc</code> installed on Windows, and since Powershell has pipes I expected to be able to do something similar, so I'm trying this:</p>

1607262,0,"<p>To start off, my knowledge in networking is quite limited so I apologize in advance if I am using the wrong terminology.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>I'm trying to create a prototype that will allow clients to communicate with a local web server on a different network. The webserver is hosted on the same network as the VPN server.
So far, I'm able to route the client packet (ex: SYN) to a virtual interface (tun) and send the entire packet to the VPN Server. On the Server side, I receive these packets, change the source and destination IPs, and recalculate the checksums inside the headers.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the flow is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>User tries to access web server with a certain ip address.</li>
<li>The SYN packet is sent to the virtual interface because it matches routes in the routing table.</li>
<li>The VPN Client application sends the SYN packet to the VPN Server through an established websocket connection (shouldn't matter what kind of connection this is)</li>
<li>The VPN Server receives the packet and modifies the source / destination ip address to point to the actual web server hosted on the same network.</li>
<li>How do I send these packets to the webserver and receive responses from the webserver? I want the client to communicate with the webserver through the VPN server / established web socket connection. What are some options I have?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>How can I send these packets to the web server, and receives packets back from the webserver to send back to the client? Do I &quot;inject&quot; packets into the correct interface and make sure my application sends the responses back to the client? I want the client to communicate with the webserver through the VPN server / established web socket connection. What are some options I have and in general, how do current VPN Server's do this?</p>
<h3>What I have tried</h3>
<p>What I've tried to do on the server side is I've created a virtual interface (tun) and wrote the packets received from the client into the interface. However, these packets do not get sent out to the webserver. The client and server are running on macOS using Network Extensions if that is of any use. The web server is running on <code>192.168.1.95</code>, and I've modified the packet's source IP to <code>100.64.0.77</code> before writing to the <code>tun</code> interface.</p>

minutes, but my devices manage to restore the connection automatically without
requiring the adapter being reset if no or few programs are active.</li>

1606915,0,"<p>My department used to be a small department. As is common with small groups, system security wasn't really enforced. In short, everyone used the same login account and had root access.
As the department has grown (about 50 people and still growing) and we've moved on to more of a production role, we've had to adjust our habits.</p>
<p>We recently implemented network logins. With this came noone has root access (or sudo).
The amount of pushback I have received from this is tremendous (as is expected) as not everyone can just <code>sudo fix problem</code>. However, sudo is dangerous, and most users are electrical engineers who aren't unix savvy. After explaining why we will not be getting sudo back, their is still tremendous pushback.</p>
<p>This is where I turn to stack exchange. As I have looked on google for why not everyone should have root access. And surprisingly, this information is hard to come by. I have tried making a list myself, but it would be good to have another online source backing up what I'm saying, which I thought there would be a plethora of articles for!</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons they want sudo access back, and how I addressed their concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can't edit other user's files in a shared directory
<ul>
<li>Don't use shared directories to edit your code. Everyone should be editing in their own home directories and pushing to git. Let git do it's job and merge stuff.</li>
<li>If for whatever reason you <em>need</em> to use shared directories, have the directory owner give the group write permissions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While using a shared directory, if one person compiles, the others can no longer compile as they'd have to remove the first binary
<ul>
<li>Same response as (1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If one person pushes to git with no group write permission, the others cannot push to git
<ul>
<li>For now, set your umask (i told them how to do this). Soon, IT will be taking over all git remote ownership and will be setting up shared permissions properly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other reasons I have come up with for why sudo access would not be good.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can't accidentally delete customer data forever (this has happened)</li>
<li>We can't <code>sudo reboot</code> and kick everyone off whos remotely logged in (someone kicked me off a few times and I lost my work)</li>

1606914,0,"<p>This is from a long time ago — so I'm probably unable to provide clear details — but I accidentally did something really dumb with a family member's external hard drive.</p>
<p>If I am remembering the details as correctly as I can, but I think it was a Western Digital drive, one of those My Passport models probably, I don't know which one for sure. I think what happened was is I was cleaning up and absentmindedly plugged in a cable into it and into a computer thinking it was fine because it fit.</p>
<p>I believe what I foolishly did was plug in a USB 2.0 to Micro-B External HDD cable into it but the cable it took was a USB 3.0 to Micro-B External HDD cable. I just remember that ports were similar but just that cable I plugged into it was so like half the size of the actual port on the drive.</p>
<p>So ever since I did that, the drive doesn't seem to power on/be recognized by the computer anymore. Is this drive beyond saving? I was never able to find anything that could help me determine if I had accidentally completely toasted the drive or if the only thing I broke was like the plug interface, so that it just wasn't receiving power and perhaps the data on the drive itself was still accessible in some way.</p>

1606574,0,"<p>I have a long report that has developed the problem of an unusually thick border. There is nothing in the footer and I have created an example document that is an emptied version of my report document with one thing in the header. The thick footer is greatly restricting how much I can fit on each page. How can I remove this thick border and return to default. Copying and pasting the entire report into a new document brings back these chunky footers. The ruler shows the footer size to be default yet in reality its much bigger. Removing footer does nothing. Changing the position does nothing. There is no spacing. This is literally driving me insane.</p>
<p>edit: I decided to re-create the report by making a new document and copying very small sections of text only. After slowly adding the original report in bit by bit, it seemed like the thick footer appeared while adding a certain line of text just before the number of columns changed. After further investigation I found that when I used different numbers of columns on the same page, other strange things started happening. Pages that were made using page breaks were undeletable after changing page size with no text cursor on the page and delete and backspace doing nothing, page size of the first page was not respected when adding a new page, an page was created at the end of the document at some point in my investigation with the same font as the line earlier in the report that caused the thick footer and was unable to be changed or the page removed. Other stuff happened that is very hard to explain clearly without an essay. Also I should mention that the default template is completely fine. The document I have shown as an example has nothing in it at all and the text style set to normal. My guess is that the template I'm required to use is old and broken. My new report document that I made from scratch to look like the template works.</p>

<p>However, I don't think I will stay on top of keeping this list up to date. If my version of ssh is updated to include better ciphers, I want to be able to take advantage of those automatically (which is what would happen if I don't modify my configuration file). By trying to eliminate algorithms I do not want to use (for instance, <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code>), I have also locked myself in to not using anything better than the best currently supported algorithm.</p>
<p>Is there a way to configure ssh and sshd to say &quot;Do not consider these algorithms&quot; without also saying &quot;And also don't consider anything except these other algorithms&quot;?</p>
<p>I would accept answers specific to openssh and Linux, and you can assume I am using very new versions of relevant software.</p>

<p>I have 3 monitors (well, 2 + TV) and need to switch between them often enough that the default Windows GUI way (which involves about 10 clicks, some scrolling and some waiting) is getting on my nerves. This is on a home PC runnign Windows 10 Pro if relevant.</p>
<p>There are two setups that I need to toggle between, see image:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4oIyf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Display setups</a></p>
<p>Case one: <strong>display 1</strong>: main, 2560x1440 <strong>display 2</strong>: disconnected <strong>display 3</strong>: 1920x1080, rotated by 90°, extending desktop</p>
<p>Case two: <strong>display 1</strong>: main, 1920x1080 <strong>display 2</strong>: duplicating 1 <strong>display 3</strong>: disconnected</p>
<p>I want to have a short script that would on execution simply toggle between the two configutation, so that I would reduce all that configuration to a single doubleclick from desktop. I expected there would be something that would allow me to select a display by its Windows-assigned ID and set its properties the way I have summed up above. Surely if you can do it via clicking in the GUI, there must be a way to do it via command line? But I found none.</p>
<p>There is the MS displayswitch.exe tool which is way too basic for this case.</p>
<p>An often recommended tool is the MultiMonitor Tool from Nirsoft. In my experience it fails at this because it seems unable to set display as duplicate, and also it seems to get confused which display is which. I tried saving both configurations while they were active and then loading them, and it botches the job, ending up with something completely different.</p>

When I connect a client, the client can see other workstations on the VPN host's network, but not the VPN host system itself.  I can't even ping it.  I've disabled the Windows firewall on both ends and it still doesn't work.</p>

1606900,0,"<p>My goals on Windows 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>For wireless connected users to be bridged or routed to the OpenVPN Tap network.</li>
<li>For any console or RDC logged in user to have normal (not VPN) access to the internet.</li>
<li>On system startup the headless and auto-start of all components.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can manually set the OpenVPN Tap adapter to share with Wireless Network 3 (MS Virtual Wifi Miniport) but the share is not persistent - after reboot another manual share setting is required. There is no W7 patch to fix this.</p>
<p>The wireless hosted network was created with:</p>
<pre><code>netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow &quot;ssid=MySSID&quot; &quot;key=MyKey&quot; keyUsage=persistent 
netsh wlan start hostednetwork 
</code></pre>
<p>The second netsh is not persistent – after reboot the hosted network is not started. I can fix that in the script that starts the VPN.</p>
<p>On SuperUser I found “<a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/394505/how-can-i-setup-a-win-7-pc-as-a-router"">How can I setup a win 7 PC as a router?</a>”.</p>
<p>From postings at SuperUser on routing between two NICs it seems two routes are required. I’m still confused on how to construct the two routes. I also have the requirement for console and RDC users have non-VPN internet access. And all this on the one NIC, I hope.</p>

<p>Today we achieve this by having one user account (UserX) and both HumanA and HumanB know the password to UserX.</p>

Googling for this beep code gave me no meaningful results (it's certainly not a keyboard problem).
After many (around 30) tries of booting, it sometimes gets through and then I can use my PC for days (without powering down) without a problem. But once a few days my screens are black, keyboard lights frozen. After restarting my PC, I'm again faced with the boot issue.</p>
<p>My first though was that it is a GPU problem, as I could boot when I removed my GPU and used my motherboard video. However, that seems to have been a fluke.</p>
<p>Today removing the GPU didn't help as well and I started investigating further. I removed all devices attached to my PC. I unplugged all SATA cables (I don't have an M.2 SSD), removed my GPU, used a different PSU and removed 2 of the 3RAM sticks, changing which one of the 3 I used. I did a CMOS reset and used a new CMOS battery. I still couldn't boot, with the same beep code.</p>
<p>I plugged everything in again and started the boot loop. After about 20 minutes the PC finally booted successfuly. After confirming the UEFI default settings, and a rather long boot, Windows started without problems.</p>
<p>So... that's the current situation. I can use my PC but I'm afraid of rebooting it or powering down for any reason.</p>

1606736,0,"<p>I've had hard drives fail before, and they often clicked near the end. My laptop is a 2016 Lenovo Z51 with a magnetic HD, and it recently started making strange sounds while idle about once every two hours or so. It's closer to a loud chirp than the clicking I've heard with other drives, but I'm worried that it's the hard drive.</p>
<p>Things I've tried to rule out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy/extended hard drive seek noises (e.g. when swapping, swapoffing, or opening large directories/files): The odd sound is louder and isolated and seemingly happens even when idle, not just when I know there's I/O.</li>
<li>Isolated hard drive seek noises (e.g. with &lt;10 terminals open or when browsing): With light I/O, I often get similar sounds, but the recent noises are much louder.</li>
<li>Speaker mute/unmute noises: Muting/unmuting the speaker on Windows (but not Linux with ALSA or Pulseaudio) produces a loud click, but it's just a mildly irritating burst of white noise and not a chirping sound.</li>
<li>Stray audio: I don't have any system sounds in my default environment, and the chirps persist even when muted.</li>
</ul>
<p>My question is mostly one of whether I should run fsck at this point as opposed to replacing the drive (or if it's something innocuous). If it's not the hard drive, are there any particular components it's likely to be instead? Is there a relatively nondestructive way to pin down what's wrong?</p>
