<ol>
<li><p>It seems you have a typo in your config file as <code>HndleLidSwitch=ignore</code> where it should be <code>HandleLidSwitch=ignore</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is likely the issue with that parameter not being parsed correctly so I'd start by getting this corrected first in case it's as simple as that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore, as per <a href=""https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/logind.conf.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">logind.conf, logind.conf.d — Login manager configuration files</a> as few key things to note that I read:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Only input devices with the &quot;power-switch&quot; udev tag will be watched for key/lid switch events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the system is inserted in a docking station, or if more than one display is connected, the action specified by <code>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</code>
occurs; if the system is on external power the action (if any)
specified by <code>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</code> occurs; otherwise the
<code>HandleLidSwitch=</code> action occurs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A different application <strong>may disable logind's handling of system power and sleep keys and the lid switch</strong> by taking a low-level inhibitor lock (&quot;handle-power-key&quot;, &quot;handle-suspend-key&quot;, &quot;handle-hibernate-key&quot;, &quot;handle-lid-switch&quot;, &quot;handle-reboot-switch&quot;).</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <strong>most commonly used by graphical desktop environments to take over suspend and hibernation handling, and to use their own configuration mechanisms.</strong> If a low-level inhibitor lock is taken, logind will not take any action when that key or switch is triggered and the Handle*= settings are irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Additionally according to a comment on the <a href=""https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11638"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HandleLidSwitch in /etc/systemd/logind.conf is ignored</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>To validate, unplug everything inside the case until you have just the motherboard and PSU. Power on and see what happens. If it powers on, add a screen and GPU if there is no builtin graphics, check again. Repeat until it no longer powers on to find the culprit.</p>

<p>The case I've got is an Obsidian 500D case and the motherboard I have is an MSI MPG Z490. I've installed the CPU, RAM, and SSD on the board with no problem, but I've had an issue with screwing the board into the case itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case claims it supports MATX, ATX, and ITX.  The motherboard you purchase is an ATX board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason I bought the case was that it supported this motherboard (I used the site pcpartpicker.com to confirm this). When I go to place the motherboard in the case, the screw holes in the board don't fully align with the standoffs on the case. I've tried wiggling the board around to try and see if I can align it, but to no avail.</p>

<p>You are aware that particular website isn't 100% accurate right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But funnily enough, I removed the IO-shield from the motherboard (It came pre-attached to it) and tried again with aligning the board. And, it aligned perfectly. With no problems at all. My question is, is this normal? Surely it should just fit on without having to go through the need to remove the IO-shield? That's needed, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's supposed to be tight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've also tried taking the IO-shield off, placing it in the case, then attaching the motherboard but it doesn't align (like before). Although, the IO-shield doesn't snap into place when I put it in the case. After looking online most other builds I've seen have the IO-shield snap into place, so perhaps I'm being too gentle? One thing I did note was that the IO-shield seems to be a little too thin, i.e. it could be moved a little bit left and right in the slot (which I assume comes from it not being snapped into place?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It shouldn't be necessary but what you describe seems to be common with this particular case.  Since the I/O shield is typically just snapped into place, the fact the I/O shield is screwed in, it looks like it was intentionally designed to be removed.</p>

<p>Is efibootmgr supposed to populate a .efi file for me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, efibootmgr just points UEFI to an EFI file</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how do I make or get an EFI file?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way to do it is to use GRUB as described here: <a href=""https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/</a></p>
<p>Which tells us we need <code>grub</code> and <code>efibootmgr</code> installed, and an EFI partition mounted. Then issue this command:</p>
<pre><code>grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=&lt;name&gt; --efi-directory=&lt;path-to-efi-mount-point&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is just the label that will appear when listing the EFI priority with efibootmgr. The command will generate an EFI file on the EFI partition and modify the EFI boot priority to point to that EFI file. The last step is to generate a grub config file.</p>
<p>Note that GRUB is a very flexible boot loader and using it to generate EFI files is just one of the many functions. The default use case for grub appears to be with BIOS instead of UEFI which is why it took me quite some time to find this invocation.</p>

<p>Why I can't access my Raspberry Pi webserver over the internet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a guess, because you haven't set up the NUC web server to be a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reverse proxy</a> (i.e. to forward web requests, based on your Dynamic DNS domain for the Raspberry Pi, to your Raspberry Pi itself).</p>
<p>Typically, only one web server can be associated with an IP address at a time (independent of Dynamic DNS names). So when an external request (e.g. 4G) for ex.<code> mypi.noip.com</code> is received by your NUC, it likely simply drops it. You need to explicitly tell the NUC web server software to pass requests for ex.<code> mypi.noip.com</code> to the Raspberry Pi on your local network. The NUC would then return any messages from the Raspberry Pi (e.g. a web page) to any external client.</p>

However, in general, low-end consumer routers' &quot;DMZs&quot; typically place a given device &quot;outside&quot; your router's firewall settings (your router firewall settings no longer have any affect on the device). This has the advantage that you no longer need to set up ex. port forwarding. That said, it generally has the disadvantage that <em>all</em> incoming requests are sent to that device.

I had no idea this application existed, but Windows now has a program called &quot;Terminal&quot;. Not cmd.exe or conhost.exe, but a separate application...I find it quite good. It houses command-line programs, has a few different abilities included tabbed sessions, and..... (drum-roll) for me it solves this &quot;text squished up against the left edge&quot; issue, as there seems to be a slight left-edge buffer for any and all (so far as I've used it) console output.</p>

<p>If you kinda look at it, you can see that where I did <code>&gt; echo hello</code> in both the standard cmd.exe (foreground) and the Terminal application, &quot;hello&quot; in cmd is smushed right up against the edge...(hence why some of the previous output in the program I was working on has 1 space right before each line)...but in Terminal there's a bit of a gap between &quot;hello&quot; and the left edge.
In fact, there's a small gap even between the prompt and the edge. (Presumably/hopefully, all output and the edge.)</p>

Find the path to <code>dotnet.exe</code> manually (usually <code>C:\Program Files\dotnet</code>) and add it to PATH. Check in Control Panel whether there is a version actually installed.

<p>User Defined Functions (UDFs) are very easy to <strong>install</strong> and use:</p>
<ol>
<li>ALT-F11  brings up the VBE window</li>
<li>ALT-I
ALT-M opens a fresh module</li>
<li>paste the stuff in and close the VBE window</li>
</ol>
<p>If you save the workbook, the UDF will be saved with it.
If you are using a version of Excel later then 2003, you must save
the file as .xlsm rather than .xlsx</p>
<p>To <strong>remove</strong> the UDF:</p>
<ol>
<li>bring up the VBE window as above</li>
<li>clear the code out</li>
<li>close the VBE window</li>

<blockquote>
<p>So &quot;on paper&quot;, everything seems to look great. However, when I'm trying to move files from my HDD to the SSD, I'm only getting about 50-70 MB/s. I assumed that the bottleneck here is the speed limit of the HDD read access...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s exactly right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I don't understand is why this bogs down my whole system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is because you are loading the disk <em>100%</em>. It is squeezing out every bit of read speed it can offer. The target drive is just <em>so much faster</em>.</p>
<p>Windows will start to hang a lot when the system drive (and perhaps drives with page files) is excessively loaded, because it now competes for I/O bandwidth. Even if Windows inserts its own I/O operations into the queue, the drive is still super busy in total. In fact, on a mechanical hard drive, more seeking will reduce performance even further.</p>
<p>All this is much less severe on SSDs, because they offer vastly superior random access performance (well over 100 times faster on decent SSDs), even compared to the fastest enterprise HDDs. That means equal distribution of I/O bandwidth is much more feasible.</p>
<p>You absolutely should migrate your operating system to the SSD. You can still use separate partitions for Windows and whatever other data you have.</p>
<p>Maybe just get another SSD because you will not want to use your HDD anymore.</p>
",219095,1605203
1606488,2020-12-01 15:57:02.837,0,"<p>Yep, your HDD is fully saturated servicing the file copy since the SSD can handle anything the HDD can throw at it (and more :). plus it has to actually seek back and forth from the data that is being copied and the programs/files you're trying to access...</p>
<p>As a workaround, try a file copier that supports throttling local file transfer speeds, like <a href=""https://fastcopy.jp/en/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FastCopy</a> or lowering the I/O priority of the process that is copying the file with something like <a href=""https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Process Hacker</a>.</p>

1606491,2020-12-01 16:03:16.217,1,"<p>You're mixing up units. The uppercase <code>B</code> means &quot;byte&quot;, not &quot;bit&quot; (that's lowercase <code>b</code>).</p>
<p>So 10 MiB means 10 mebi<em>bytes</em>, which would be 80 megabits, but the network link also has to carry IP/TCP/SMB packet headers, so the extra ~3% overhead makes it approximately 100 megabits.</p>
",1686,1606482
1606494,2020-12-01 16:08:43.600,1,"<p>There are a couple ways.</p>
<p>One way is to set all your Page Margins to 0 (if your printer cannot print all the way to the edge you will get a warning that it is outside the printable area), set the Table width to 100% or however many inches wide the page is, then set the row height to the height of the page (I like to set &quot;Row height is&quot; to &quot;Exactly&quot; instead of &quot;At least&quot; and also un-check &quot;Allow row to break across pages&quot; they're not necessary but may help). Now you should have a single cell table that fully covers the page. If you need multiple columns or rows you'll need to either split the table and figure out the measurements for each column and row to maintain full coverage or create a nested table.</p>
<p>Another way is to change the Table's Text Wrapping option to &quot;Around&quot; which (if you know HTML) is very similar to floating the table so you can &quot;break out&quot; of containers. Then click the &quot;Positioning...&quot; button and set them as shown in my attached image. The important settings on the Table Positioning are the &quot;Realitive to&quot; options, you want those set to &quot;Page&quot; and the distance all set to 0. Then same as the first method, set the Table width to the width of the page and the row height to the height of the page.</p>
<p>Note: It can be a little cumbersome getting the heights and widths just right especially when you start adding content and breaking up cells, but you can get it there adjusting the heights of the rows and widths of the table/columns. If you are planning to have this table as the only thing in your document, Word, for whatever reason, forces a new line at the end of the document. You may get stuck with a blank page at the end. I can sometimes get around that by setting the new line's paragraph settings to have no spacing and the smallest font possible and make my table height just a little less to allow the newline room on the first page.</p>

You are dealing with <a href=""http://word.mvps.org/faqs/formatting/workwithsections.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Section Properties</a> and with <a href=""http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Recap_of_Header/Footer_settings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Headers and Footers</a> which are a part of Section Properties.</p>

<li><a href=""http://word.mvps.org/faqs/formatting/workwithsections.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Header and Footer Settings Recap</a> on my web site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>In the Middle of a Document With Other Text</h2>
<p>If your table is in other text and you want to have normal margins for that other text, you will need to set your document up to have page SECTION breaks around it. This is done under the Layout Tab. Before your table: Breaks &gt; Next Page and after Breaks &gt; Next Page.</p>
<p>Then in the Headers and Footers Tab make sure your headers and footers are not &quot;Linked to Previous.&quot; Do this for both the header and footer. This should be done in the section that contains your table and the following section. Then make the changes to the headers and footers in the section that contains your table without changing others.</p>
<h2>Header and Footer Size - Do this after adding section breaks!</h2>
<p>While you cannot remove headers and footers in Word <em>(they are a part of the document structure)</em>, you can shrink them. This can be done in the Header/Footer Tab or in the Page Layout dialog. You can change the distance reserved to .1.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLoET.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLoET.png"" alt=""Controls on Header/Footer Tab"" /></a></p>
<p>Note that each header and footer has an <em>empty paragraph</em> in it. You can see these by displaying non-printing formatting marks. While you cannot delete those empty paragraphs, you can also shrink them. Go into each header and footer. Use Ctrl+A to select all text and then change the font size to 1 point. (You have to type the 1.)</p>
<p>Your header and footer may also have paragraph spacing set for space before or space after. This is paragraph formatting and can be changed in the Format Paragraph dialog that you can reach by clicking on the Dialog Launcher (little arrow in the bottom right of the Paragraph Group).</p>
<h2>Final Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any change in the Printer Driver being used changes the printable area. This may be different on different computers even if they are using the same printer.</li>
<li>Page numbering gets trickier with multiple sections. See my writing on <a href=""http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#PageNumbers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Page Numbering in Word</a>.</li>

I have 2 SSDs, OS is installed on 1 and the paging file on 2.

<p>Nowadays <code>sh</code> is <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/98912/108618"">not necessarily the legacy Bourne shell</a>. Nowadays <code>sh</code> is a shell that supports <em>at least</em> the features required by POSIX (assuming a correct implementation). POSIX specifies the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sh</code> utility</a> and the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/shell.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shell Command Language</a>.</p>
<p>I assume you want your code to work in a POSIX shell and to be portable in general.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p><a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/278465/108618""><code>dd ibs=1 count=…</code> is a POSIX way to read an exact number of bytes</a>. It seems to be the only portable command line utility that can do the job reliably. But <code>dd</code> reads bytes, while <code>read -n</code> in Bash reads <em>characters</em>. <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html#tag_06_02"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">POSIX allows multi-byte characters in locales other than <code>POSIX</code></a>. Even if you run the entire script with <code>LC_ALL=POSIX</code>, the terminal (terminal emulator) may still generate a multi-byte sequence upon some single keystroke. Such sequence may not be a multi-byte character; it may be an escape sequence (<a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/211923/108618"">e.g. for <kbd>F1</kbd></a>, also see <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/116630/108618"">this answer</a>).</p>
<p>After you read just one byte, the rest will remain and it will be read by anything that tries to read from the terminal later (it may be a part of your script or the interactive shell you run the script from).</p>
<p>Additionally if you run sole <code>dd ibs=1 count=1</code> then you will most likely discover that nothing gets to <code>dd</code> until you exceed <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html#tag_11_01_05"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>{MAX_INPUT}</code> or <code>{MAX_CANON}</code></a>, or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/110248/108618""><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd></a> (and in case of <code>count</code> being more than <code>1</code>, if you want to provide less bytes then you may need to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/21261742/10765659"">twice</a>).</p>
<p>To deal with these issues you need the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html#tag_11_01_07"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-canonical mode</a>. Use <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/stty.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>stty -icanon</code></a>. In general starting with <code>stty raw</code> looks like a good idea.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The following example is a proof of concept. Because it manipulates line settings of the terminal and reads from the terminal <strong>you <em>must not</em> paste it into an interactive shell, this won't work</strong>. Paste it into a file and run the file.</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/sh

echo &quot;Press any key to continue.&quot;

saveterm=&quot;$(stty -g)&quot;                     # save terminal state
stty raw
stty -echo -icanon min 1 time 0           # prepare to read one byte
dd ibs=1 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null   # read one byte
stty -icanon min 0 time 0                 # prepare to read lefotvers
while read none; do :; done               # read leftovers
stty $saveterm                            # restore terminal state
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The script doesn't check if its stdin is a terminal, but in general it should (<a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/401938/108618""><code>[ -t 0 ]</code></a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a sane setup a modifier key (e.g. <kbd>Shift</kbd>), when pressed alone, sends no input to whatever reads from the terminal; therefore our code will not register such key as &quot;any key&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;read leftovers&quot; trick is taken from <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/1268886/432690"">this answer</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thanks to <code>stty raw</code> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> can be &quot;any key&quot; as well, instead of sending <code>SIGINT</code> or <code>SIGSTOP</code> respectively. Still the shell interpreting the script may get a signal from elsewhere, so in general it may happen it exits before it gets to <code>stty $saveterm</code>; so it may happen it leaves the terminal in a state not suitable for interactive use. You may want to trap relevant signals and restore the initial state of the terminal anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's true <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/131767/108618"">one should double-quote variables</a> in general. Here <code>$saveterm</code> is deliberately not quoted because <code>stty -g</code> generates output that is unspecified. Implementations of <code>stty</code> are allowed to generate output with spaces and later expect the shell to split it and pass multiple arguments. What is specified is a constraint that the output of <code>stty -g</code> must be safe when unquoted, it must not trigger word expansion in a shell. For portability unquoted <code>$saveterm</code> is better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To know what byte was read you need to save the output of <code>dd</code>, either to a regular file (<code>&gt;some_file</code>) that you will examine later, or to a variable (<code>variable=&quot;$(dd …)&quot;</code>). But:</p>
<ul>
<li>A terminal is able to generate a null byte (commonly with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd>) but most (all?) implementations of <code>sh</code> cannot store a null byte in a variable. Storing in a file is OK, if only you can examine/manipulate its content without reading it into a variable.</li>
<li><code>dd</code> from the above code will give you only one byte, it may not be enough to tell the character or the key. OTOH a single byte should be enough to tell apart e.g. <kbd>Q</kbd> from anything else, so <code>Press Q to quit or any other key to continue.</code> or <code>P - proceed; B - back; Q - quit; H - help</code> seem possible to implement without analyzing more bytes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>What about more bytes?</h3>
<p>The above should be fine for &quot;press any key&quot;. A real equivalent of <code>read -n</code> should read one byte at a time and decode the sequence until it gets the desired number of <em>characters</em>. I'm not going to try to build it here.</p>

<p>Since a long time, you may have made so many custom settings in Microsoft Outlook that you can’t reset to the default settings easily. These custom settings may affect your daily work or even make your Outlook collapse. Now you’d better reset your Microsoft Outlook to the factory settings (or first time run).</p>
<p>To reset Microsoft Outlook to the factory settings (or first time run), please do as following:</p>
<p>Step 1: Close your Microsoft Outlook, and open the Control Panel in your computer:</p>
<p>In Windows 7, please click the Start button at the bottom-left corner of Taskbar &gt; Control Panel.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L2jTI.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter image description here</a>
In Windows 8, swipe the cursor to the very right edge of the screen, click the Settings button, and then click the Control Panel. See screen shot:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wCUlv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter image description here</a>
In Windows 10, you can search the Control Panel in the search bar by clicking at the Start button, or click at the Start buuton &gt; Settings, in the Settings window, type Control Panel into the searching box, then enable the Control Panel.

Step 2: Now you get into the Control Panel:</p>
<p>(1) Change current view to Small icons (or Large icons) with clicking the text besides View by and select the Small icons (or Large icons) from drop down list;</p>
<p>(2) Then click the Mail in the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Step 3: In the popping up Mail Setup dialog box, please click the Show Profiles button.</p>
<p>Step 4: In the coming Mail dialog box, please click the Add button.</p>
<p>Step 5: In the popping up New Profile dialog box, enter a name for the new profile in the Profile Name box, and then click the OK button. See screen shot:</p>
<p>Step 6: In the popping Add (New E-mail) Account dialog box, please click the Cancel to close it; and then click the OK button in the other warning dialog box.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now you will get back to the Mail dialog box, please check the option of Always use this profile, and then click the box below it and select the new profile name from the drop down list, at last click the OK button.</p>
<p>Step 8: Exit the Control Panel.</p>
<p>After configuring the profile settings, the Microsoft Outlook will get back to the factory settings (the status you run for the first time). When you open Microsoft Outlook, it will show as following screen shot:</p>
<p>Note: Resetting Microsoft Outlook to the factory settings will lose all account information. If you need to undo the resetting, please get into the Mail dialog box (Control Panel &gt; Mail &gt; Show Profiles), and then specify your original profile in the Always use this profile box.</p>

<p>The reason is that in Windows 10, by default, support for the SMB v 1 protocol is disabled. And Windows XP uses this version of the protocol for network exchange.</p>
<p>The problem can be solved simply. You need to install the SMB v 1 component. To do this, you need to open the Windows 10 settings (via the Start menu), and there open the &quot;Applications and features&quot; settings group. In this group you need to find and open &quot;Programs and Features&quot;
In the list of programs, you need to open &quot;Turn on or off by Windows component&quot;.
In the list of components, you need to find and mark the components &quot;SMB Client and Server 1&quot;.
After installing the components, you need to check that the same Workgroup is specified in the computer names settings. And on a Windows 10 computer, disable password-protected sharing, unless of course you need to restrict access on your local network.</p>

<p>If the laptop will fold out totally flat so you could apply it with the same quality of light seal to another display, then you have at least a start-point - you'd then need to track down the profile it made on the laptop &amp; persuade the OS on the display's usual computer to use it as default.<br />
In theory, changing the GPU etc as you swap machines should not affect this calibration.

<p>I believe this is an issue with the default Rsync version on macOS being out of date due to GNU licensing issues.</p>
<p>The default macOS version of <code>rsync</code> exists in this path <code>/usr/bin/rsync</code> and has this version when this command is run <code>/usr/bin/rsync --version</code></p>
<pre><code>rsync  version 2.6.9  protocol version 29
</code></pre>
<p>I believe since your paths include non-Western / Chinese characters, this older 2.6.9 version of Rsync is choking on those characters.</p>
<p>You can use a more up-to-date version of Rsync on macOS if you install it via <a href=""https://brew.sh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Homebrew</a>. Just install it by opening up a terminal session and entering this command:</p>
<pre><code>/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Then run this command:</p>
<pre><code>brew install rsync
</code></pre>
<p>Once that command does what it has to do, an updated version of Homebrew should be installed here and you can check the version installed by running <code>/usr/local/bin/rsync --version</code> which should be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>rsync  version 3.2.3  protocol version 31
</code></pre>
<p>I used full paths for the version checking, but after that Homebrew install command is run you can just run <code>rsync --version</code> to check version and <code>which rsync</code> to check which version of Rsync is being preferred by the system.</p>

<p>I suspect you may have mistaken the terminology. In your workflow you probably use two or more <em>clients</em> attached to <em>the same</em> session. I'm not aware of any method to turn the status line off for a particular client. I think you need more than one session.</p>
<p><sup>(Note: whenever this answer states a command starting with <code>tmux</code>, it's a command to be run in a shell. A command not starting with <code>tmux</code> is a command to run in tmux (after <kbd>prefix</kbd><kbd>:</kbd> or from a key binding). Usually you can convert one form to the other (or vice versa) by removing (or prepending) the <code>tmux</code> word.)</sup></p>
<p>There are at least two ways to get the same window in another session:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can share one or more windows between multiple sessions. Let's suppose there already is session <code>0</code> with a window <code>0:0</code>. Instead of attaching to the session <code>0</code> with another client (<code>tmux attach</code>), create a new session (<code>tmux new-session</code> or <code>tmux new</code> in short). Let's say the new session is <code>1</code>. Then you can <code>link-window</code> the old window to the new session:</p>
<pre><code>tmux link-window -s 0:0 -t 1:
</code></pre>
<p>A complementary command is <code>unlink-window</code>. Other windows can be created, linked or unlinked in each session independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can create a new session in the same session group. Instead of attaching to the session <code>0</code> with another client (<code>tmux attach</code>), create a new session like this:</p>
<pre><code>tmux new -t 0:
</code></pre>
<p>The new session will be denoted <code>0-1</code> or similar. Sessions in the same group share the same set of windows. New windows are linked to all sessions in the group and any windows closed removed from all sessions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please compare <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/1489266/432690"">this another answer of mine</a> posted under a question from a person who inadvertently did something like this.</p>
<p>One way or another now you have <em>two</em> sessions that share at least one window. You can <code>set status off</code> or <code>set status on</code> for each session independently. Doing it from a shell from within a shared window may target the wrong session, so either explicitly specify the session you want to affect:</p>
<pre><code>tmux set -t 0-1: status off
</code></pre>
<p>or don't do this via a shell, do this directly in tmux:</p>
<pre><kbd>prefix</kbd><kbd>:</kbd>set status off<kbd>Enter</kbd></pre>
<p>Possibly you will need just two sessions: one with a status line and one without. Remember you can name them (from the start with <code>new-session -s …</code> or later with <code>rename-session</code>). This way instead of <code>0:</code>, <code>1:</code> or <code>0-1:</code> you can use more descriptive custom names, e.g. <code>w</code> (like warriors: task- and timewarrior) and <code>w-noline</code>.</p>

<p>You can easily launch tmux in the background, launching an application.  Tmux provides an API to send key strokes to the application, as well as connect the application to the terminal if you want to interact with it.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ tmux new-session -d -s Super

</code></pre>
<p><code>new-session -d -s Super</code> Create a new session called <code>Super</code> in the background (-d). Note <code>-s</code> to new-session names the <em>session</em>.  I havent named an application to run, so a shell is launched.</p>
<p><code>send-keys -t Super: &quot;command&quot; &quot;Enter&quot;</code> Send the keystrokes.  Tmux understands many keywords like Enter, PgUp, Escape, etc, otherwise sending UTF and raw codes via <code>send-keys -t Super: $'command\n'</code> also works.  Note the <code>-t</code> refers to a <em>target</em> which includes <code>[session]:[window id]:[pane #]</code>.  Since I have only the default window and pane, I leave them blank and refer only to the session. If I know there were no other sessions running, I could leave out <code>-t</code> entirely.</p>
<p><code>capture-pane -t Super: -S [start] -E [end] -p</code> Copies the contents of the window.  By default, panes are captures to internal buffers you can save, or paste to other windows.  the <code>-p</code> causes the contents to be piped to the screen.  Note the captured data can be much longer than a screenfull.</p>
<p>The best part is, if you have left the application or session running, <code>tmux attach -t Super:</code> will drop you into the running session so you can interact with the application.</p>
<p>Many people use tmux to launch long running interactive programs as a background service they can attach to later, or as part of an automated test solution.</p>

<p>In general, the kernel that is installed on the system is the kernel that the system should be using. Which sounds odd to say, but that is basically it.</p>
<p>What is odd in your case is the disparity between two kernels for each Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS install. One is <code>5.3.0-1039-gke</code> and the other is <code>4.15.0-124-generic</code>. This is what I know:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5.3.0-1039-gke</code>: As far as I know the <code>gke</code> stands for “Google Kubernetes Engine” and it would seem that kernel is specific for that usage? Odd that you have that installed on a desktop system.</li>
<li><code>4.15.0-124-generic</code>: That <code>generic</code> is what it means… That is a generic version of the Kernel for that install.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general those appended designations of <code>-gke</code> and <code>-generic</code> can be read as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That is the optimized Kernel for those those specifications: <code>-gke</code> for one and <code>-generic</code> for another.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, whet you say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A few months ago I bought two used Dell Optiplex machines for use as a NAS and internet gateway, respectively.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While your post implies both machines are 100% the same, my personal feeling is something is different between the two of them. Perhaps the motherboards or BIOS’s are different? That is the only rational explanation I can see for why there is such a wide disparity between kernel versions here.</p>
<p>In general though, I would not sweat it. Yes, kernel updates are important… But mainly in the context of servers that are exposed to the world. If these are just two personal machines I highly doubt you will notice a difference between the two boxes. Just enjoy them!</p>

<p>Up to the point where you replugged the drive back onto your original machine, there was nothing wrong with it, since it had been properly detected then, and, as you should be able to tell, there's simply no way Rufus could have &quot;magically&quot; rendered your drive inoperable between the time you unplugged the drive from the computer you planned to boot it on and plugged it back on the computer you created the drive with (The message you saw when you tried to boot the USB is a simple text output produced by invoking basic BIOS functions, and not some kind of fancy executable that's accessing the USB. As a matter of fact, the <a href=""https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/blob/master/res/mbr/msg.S"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">code to display that message</a> requires no knowledge of USB, and even if it was buggy and wrote garbage data all over the drive —not a small feat considering that the code is designed to simply invoke BIOS calls to <strong>read</strong> and display data— you would just end up with an unpartitioned drive that any application could repartition and reformat since this would not, in any way, make the drive undetectable).</p>
<p>So, by the looks of it, your flash drive simply <strong>failed</strong> when you plugged it back on that other computer, and <a href=""https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/FAQ#Help_Rufus_damaged_my_flash_drive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rufus had nothing whatsoever to do with that</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, if it's not detected any longer on any of your computers, then there's nothing any software can do to salvage it. Your drive is dead and you will just have to replace it.</p>
<p>What I usually recommend, as a last resort, is to see if your drive is recognized at all on a non Windows machine (e.g. Linux). But considering that your drive can't be listed in Rufus any longer, it is most likely dead.</p>

1606634,2020-12-02 01:44:02.813,-1,"<p>I had an existing VM that was failing to boot at the same point. It happened after I had upgraded to VirtualBox 6.1. When I downgraded to 6.0.12 it still didn't work - but it did give me a more informative error:</p>
<p><code>Call to WHvSetupPartition failed: ERROR_SUCCESS (Last=0xc000000d/87) (VERR_NEM_VM_CREATE_FAILED).</code></p>
<p>This points to an issue with the widespread conflict between VirtualBox and Windows Hyper-V. The resolution involves eliminating everything that could use Hyper-V in Windows, as described <a href=""https://technology.amis.nl/2019/12/03/resolving-issue-oracle-virtual-box-6-0-14-and-windows-10-call-to-whvsetuppartition-failed-verr_nem_vm_create_failed/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. I found that I could boot to the Ubuntu 20.10 Live CD by just disabling 'Virtual Machine Platform' feature and leaving the WSL enabled (but must run version 1 to avoid conflict). This was a newly created VM with 4 processors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my existing VM still wouldn't boot and was now stuck at the point where it brings up the additional processors. I eventually got it to boot by changing the settings to use a single processor. Obviously that isn't ideal and the performance is substantially worse, so if anybody figures out a better solution please let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2 days later:</strong>
Once I had the old VM booting again I tried changing it back to using 4 processors. It successfully booted but performance still suffers. For comparison, I created a new VM with the same configuration (8GB mem, 4 CPU) and it requires about 1/6th the CPU load to run. So it appears (in my case) there is a performance drag associated with the older VMs running on the latest versions of Windows and VirtualBox, but if a new VM is created (where virtualization is disabled as noted above) then the performance issue doesn't seem to be present.</p>

<p>I'm stuck in for what to fill for 'Local Port from', 'Local Port to', 'Remote Port from' and 'Remote port to'.</p>

<p>I would guess that the fields are somewhat misnamed:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Local port&quot; is the <em>internal</em> destination port on your computer (after forwarding),</li>
<li>&quot;Remote port&quot;, then, must mean the <em>external</em> destination port on WAN side (before forwarding).</li>
<li>When the router receives a connection <em>to</em> the specified &quot;remote port&quot; it forwards that connection to your computer's &quot;local port&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each setting has two fields (&quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot;) because the router allows you to define a <em>range</em>, i.e. you could create a single rule with &quot;From: 61455&quot; and &quot;To: 61458&quot; instead of needing four separate rules. (You will still need a separate rule for 6672 however.)</p>
<p>In general, games expect the internal port to be the same as the external one. So you should just enter the same number (or the same range) in both the &quot;Local&quot; and &quot;Remote&quot; columns.</p>

<p>Is running LC_ALL=C sort -u on these files likely to strip them of any non-ASCII characters?</p>

<p>Not in this case, no – <code>sort</code> will just directly work on the byte values instead of trying to convert them to characters.</p>
<p>However, the same does not necessarily apply to other tools. Programs written in C (the language) are the most likely to behave this way. Programs written in languages with strong byte-vs-char distinction, such as in Python 3, should outright refuse to accept input that doesn't conform to the charset. And I can certainly imagine poorly-written programs which ignore the errors and output a � or a <code>?</code> instead.</p>

<p>It seems like it is one of those cmdlets less used or documented online, and is almost impossible to figure out on your own using the MSDN documentation, unless you're already very familiar with the huge world of <code>Wmi Objects</code>.</p>
<h2>In short:</h2>
<p>Assuming I  have a program <code>foo.exe</code> that needs to run on background with the arguments <code>-a</code>, <code>-b</code> and <code>bar</code>, I should be using the exact command:</p>
<pre><code>Invoke-WmiMethod -Path 'Win32_Process' -Name Create -ArgumentList 'C:\Users\foo\Desktop\foo.exe -a -b bar'
</code></pre>
<p>Of course if your exe is a &quot;known&quot; exe (either by default, such as notepad or ping) or added by you, a full path is not needed when  using the <code>-ArgumentList</code> and exe name would be sufficient (notepad, ping, and etc..).</p>
<h2>Additional parameters:</h2>
<p><code>Invoke-WmiMethod</code> supports additional parameters such as <code>-Credential</code>,  <code>-ComputerName</code> (a good way to use a local PS to <code>Invoke</code> something on a remote machine without using SSH) , <code>-Impersonation</code> and many <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/invoke-wmimethod?view=powershell-5.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more documented here</a>.</p>
<h2>Cmdlet syntax explanation and additional cmdlet tools:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>-Path</code> argument directs to a <code>WmiObject</code> name. There are <strong>dozens</strong> of <code>WmiObjects</code>, each with many <code>Methods</code> and <code>Properties</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>-Name</code> argument directs the used <code>Method</code>.</li>
<li>To list all available <code>Wmi-Objects</code> use <code>Get-WmiObject -List</code> (very difficult to locate your needed object this way).</li>
<li>To list and view all available <code>Win32_Process</code> <code>Methods</code> and <code>Properties</code> use</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Get-WmiObject -List |where{$_.name -match '^Win32_Process$'}
</code></pre>
<p>This will return an output of this structure:</p>
<pre><code>   NameSpace: ROOT\cimv2

1606732,2020-12-02 12:20:24.817,2,"<h2>Issue analysis</h2>
<p>Your problem is that Windows goes through each entry in the PATH variable and checks if a binary of the name you're calling exists in there and aborts the search on the first match. Since your PATH variable contains the Python <code>Scripts</code> entries before the common Windows paths they'll override default commands since they contain a script called ping.</p>
<p>It's uncommon to add custom paths to the beginning of the PATH variable. You usually append to its end.</p>
<h2>How to fix:</h2>
<p>Take the list above and combine all entries with <code>;</code> as delimiter. But make sure to move the following entries to the end of the list:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts\
C:\Program Files\Python36\
C:\Program Files\Python37\Scripts\
C:\Program Files\Python37\
C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.03-hotspot\bin
C:\Program Files (x86)\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.03-hotspot\bin
C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-11.0.3.7-hotspot\bin
</code></pre>
<p>Then follow these steps to update the PATH variable:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Windows desktop, right-click <strong>My Computer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the pop-up menu, click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>System Properties</strong> window, click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Environment Variables</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>System Variables</strong> window, highlight <strong>Path</strong>, and click Edit.</li>
<li>In the Edit System Variables window, replace the list with your prepared list of entries (the full list from your post, reordered, with semicolons as delimiters).
If the last character is not a semi-colon (;), add one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally reboot the computer to ensure that all programs use the updated PATH variable.</p>
<h2>Edit</h2>
<p>It seems in Windows 10 they updated the PATH editor so that when you edit the variable you get a little editor window that allows you to edit each entry separately and also allows you to move them up and down. Simply move the Python entries to the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to use faster cloning methods that skip unused sectors, but doing that before filesystem check could be unsafe. On the other hand this approach will put less stress on the (potentially) failing drive and could skip problematic drive areas.

<p>Alias is a purely textual replacement. Your alias injects so much code it would be more elegant if <code>myproject</code> was a function. This is a side &quot;issue&quot;. You can stick to the alias if you want.</p>
<p>The main issue is you're expecting <code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code> to work in the newly opened tab. When your alias replaces <code>myproject</code> with</p>
<pre><code>… gnome-terminal --tab --active &amp;&amp; cd ~/code/myproject-ember
</code></pre>
<p>and this code is executed, the fact that <code>gnome-terminal</code> is executed will not inject the next command (<code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code>) into a command line <em>there</em>. <code>cd</code> will be executed in the current shell after this particular <code>gnome-terminal</code> process exits successfully. The whole snippet is similar to:</p>
<pre><code>… true &amp;&amp; cd …
</code></pre>
<p>and there's no reason why this <code>cd</code> should be performed anywhere else than in the shell that executes the whole command.</p>
<p>Your attempt with <code>gnome-terminal --tab -e &quot;cd ~/code/myproject-ember&quot;</code> fails because:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> is never expanded. I understand the tilde is single-quoted when you define the alias. Then after the alias expansion it's <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/151850/108618"">double-quoted</a>. Then <code>gnome-terminal</code> receives the string <code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code>, splits it to words (without expanding the tilde) and tries to run the resulting command, but not in a shell (that could otherwise finally expand the tilde).</li>
<li>Running <code>cd</code> this way makes no sense. <code>cd …</code> is executed not in a shell; this requires a <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/38808/108618"">separate <code>cd</code> executable</a>, you may or may not have it in your OS. Even if you had it and even if the tilde was expanded, <code>gnome-terminal</code> would execute <code>cd</code> that would do its pointless job (change its own directory) and exit; and there would be nothing more to do in this tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>The right way to make <code>gnome-terminal</code> start an interactive shell in some directory is <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/75223/693277"">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>gnome-terminal --working-directory=/path/to/dir
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly as before, <code>gnome-terminal</code> won't expand <code>~</code> if it gets it after <code>--working-directory=</code>. Better use <code>$HOME</code> and and make sure it's expanded by your current shell. If you choose to use an alias, it may be:</p>
<pre><code>alias myproject='cd ~/code/myproject-rails &amp;&amp; rails s &amp; cd ~/code/myproject-ember &amp;&amp; ember s &amp; gnome-terminal --tab --active &quot;--working-directory=$HOME/code/myproject-ember&quot;'
</code></pre>
<p>In this case <code>$HOME</code> will be expanded after each alias expansion.</p>
<p>As I said, IMO a function would be more elegant:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>unalias myproject
myproject () {
   cd ~/code/myproject-rails &amp;&amp; rails s &amp;
   cd ~/code/myproject-ember &amp;&amp; ember s &amp;
   gnome-terminal --tab --active &quot;--working-directory=$HOME/code/myproject-ember&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note <code>rails</code> and <code>ember</code> will become jobs in the <em>old</em> shell. I don't know what they are but <em>maybe</em> you'd like to have them as jobs in the new shell. It can be done but I won't elaborate here. (If you need it and don't find a solution, ask a separate question.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Three cameras are very likely to not have <strong>exactly</strong> the same frame rate. Even a 1/1000 inequality in the time bases at 25fps will give you a difference of a complete frame every 40 seconds</li>
<li>For the stream to &quot;start&quot; (i.e. the first output image to appear) the decoder needs to wait for the first full image (I-frame), on which the following B-frames and P-frames can be built. This is upper-bounded by the GOP length, which is typically in the 1-2 second range for streaming cameras. Since I-frames are most often not only scheduled at each GOP border, but also on significantly changed image content (&quot;oportunistic&quot; I-frames on scene change), it is very unlikely, that they come at the same time. This implies, that for a multi-input case, the minimum delay is the maximum time delta between I-frames in the different streams. <strong>Remember: A h.264 stream can by design not be interpreted from any given point in time on, but only from the first keyframe (I-frame) following that point in time</strong></li>

<p>Sorry, that's not correct.  What you see is the translated address of your local devices.  That address is different than the IP address of the router interface.</p>
<p>When you browse the Internet, your router translates your internal, private IP of your PC (usually 192.168.0.x) to a public IP.  Your router remembers that translation for the duration of the browsing session -- when you leave the website, the translation is &quot;forgotten&quot; until you browse to a new site.</p>
<p>So if your girlfriend tries to ping your translated address, your router doesn't have the translation for your PC anymore.  So the ping is dropped.</p>

1606840,2020-12-02 19:56:47.893,1,"<p>Well, it's hard to see the point of what you're doing with just this formula to look at.</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> it is taken as essentially your plan, with the exception of the error Excel reports, then you have the following concept in your formula:</p>
<p><em>IF some condition (N16=1 in this case) is TRUE, then report THIS (whatever &quot;THIS&quot; is) and if it is not TRUE, report THIS (whatever &quot;THIS&quot; is) ANYWAY.</em></p>
<p>That boils down to being the same as the following:</p>
<pre><code>=IF(A1=1,50,50)
</code></pre>
<p>The point being that if you get the same results for TRUE and for FALSE, then there's no point in the <code>IF()</code>. Note that there can be reasons external to the logic in the situation and, who knows, one of them may apply. Since you give no information meaningful to resolving THAT, one cannot say. But if none do, and that seems very likely, why use the <code>IF()</code> at all?</p>
<p>So only the result of either TRUE or FALSE matters here (since they are the same). You can simplify your formula by just using one of those portions of the formula.</p>
<p>That's if you want to &quot;simplify&quot; it. If you'd rather <strong>GREATLY simplify</strong> it, then consider what each test does. Your basic result in each test is to subtract 2 from some cell, then multiply it by the test cell. Cool. If that test cell is blank, Excel will consider it to be 0 and that multiplication will give you 0. So why bother testing whether it is blank if the reason to do so is to make the result 0? <em>Just the actual multiplication will do that for you without anything else needed.</em> If you drop the extra work, and the whole <code>IF()</code> idea, you get the following:</p>
<pre><code>=(2  *  C8*(D8-2)  -  C9*(D9-2)  -  C11*(D11-2)  +  C12*(D12-2)  )  /2
</code></pre>
<p>and since there seems to be no reason to multiply that by 2, then divide it by 2, take that out as well:</p>
<pre><code>=C8*(D8-2)  -  C9*(D9-2)  -  C11*(D11-2)  +  C12*(D12-2)
</code></pre>
<p>I'll take it that the expected &quot;C10*(D10-2)&quot; is not there for good reasons and go onward.</p>
<p>Stopping the simplifying at this point (since anyway, technically speaking, anything more happens to be &quot;streamlining&quot; more than &quot;simplifying&quot; in this case), I'd point out one huge advantage to using the above and not your formula:</p>
<p>It's so simple, and easy to type or generate, that silly entry errors should be hard to have happen, and should be extraordinarily easy to figure out if they do. Contrast that will your formula and the advantage should be easy to see.</p>

This ended up being a little harder than expected, not least because it took me a while to realise that <code>file</code> isn't reliable at determining whether a file is ASCII or UTF-8 (because it doesn't check the whole of the file), so I'm putting this answer up here for posterity.</p>
<p>To definitively determine what encoding your files are in, first make sure the <code>uchardet</code> package is installed via the Cygwin Installer or <a href=""https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apt-cyg</a>, then run:</p>
<pre><code>uchardet *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you're not on Cygwin:</p>
<pre><code>chardet *.txt 
</code></pre>
<p>Move all of the files that <code>chardet</code> lists as <code>ASCII</code> to a folder of their own, and run the following <code>for</code> loop in that folder:</p>
<pre><code>for i in *.txt; do iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-8 &quot;$i&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;${i%.txt}_utf.txt&quot;; done;
</code></pre>
<p>It will loop through all <code>.txt</code> files in a folder and create UTF-8 versions of them with the <code>utf</code> suffix added.</p>
<p>Running <code>uchardet *.txt</code> again may still show some files as being <code>ASCII</code>. This happens because ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36030982/1191147"">simply means</a> that those files don't contain characters outside the ASCII range of 128 bits.</p>
<p>You should now be able to run <code>sort</code> without needing to use <code>LC_ALL=C</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at dealing with mkv/webm format files which I prefer, I realized there is a great open source package called MKVtoolNix which includes mkvmerge, and as long as you are using a single video file or multiple files with similar formats, it simply defaults to doing the piping and mapping properly, and it accepts <em>very simple</em> syntax to take multiple segments of video and concatenate them perfectly, even supporting chapter information quite easily.</p>
<p>And MKVtoolNix apparently does no transcoding or reencoding so it's inherently very fast and lossless. Output files seem small and optimized. Subtitles and many intricacies of this process are handled by default or with ease. I would keep around ffmpeg for doing a quick cleanup of seek indexing via a &quot;-c copy&quot; command option though.</p>

<p>The key point, which took me some time to find, is the correct ProgID for Adobe Acrobat.
The way I found it is searching the registry for <code>acrobat.exe</code> (launch <code>regedit.exe</code>, and then &lt;Ctrl&gt;+f -&gt; <code>acrobat.exe</code>, with all 3 checkboxes ticked).
<br>
I found key <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.eps\UserChoice</code> contains <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/structure-of-the-registry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">values</a> (as Name/Data) <code>Hash</code>/&lt;hash&gt; and <code>ProgId</code>/<code>Applications\Acrobat.exe</code></p>
<p>So I executed</p>
<pre><code>&gt; SetUserFTA.exe .pdf Applications\Acrobat.exe
</code></pre>
<p>and voilà, Acrobat was the default application.
I checked this worked consistently by alternately executing the above and</p>
<pre><code>&gt; SetUserFTA.exe .pdf AcroExch.Document
</code></pre>
<p>which alternated between Acrobat and Reader as default applications.</p>
<p>Note that data for the value <code>Hash</code> changed after each execution of commands above, even for the same data for value <code>ProgId</code>.
This is the &quot;protection&quot; role of the <code>Hash</code>, and the reason one needs to use <code>SetUserFTA.exe</code> or an alternative method, but not changing directly the data for value <code>ProgId</code>.</p>

1606945,2020-12-03 06:18:04.133,2,"<p>There is one instance of the OS network data structures per network namespace. You could count this is one &quot;stack&quot;. You could also count different network protocol stacks (like IPv4 and IPv6, or even older ones that are still supported by Linux) separately, then you'd have one each per network namespace.</p>
<p>All network interfaces in a network namespace belong to the same network stack (or several, if you count different protocols). There are various tables that either reference a particular interface (routing, firewall) or are per-interface (address assignment), but they still belong to the same kernel data structure instance.</p>
<p>The loopback interface is no different in this respect, though it plays a special role in the network stack (it's used whenever a transmission from a local address to a local address is involved, and it also offers a way to assign dedicated local IP addresses). So there is one loopback interface per network namespace (and hence network stack).</p>

<h3>PS/2 vs. USB</h3>
<p>Make sure you created the &quot;CrashOnCtrlScroll&quot; value in the correct Registry key location.  There are different key locations for PS/2 vs. USB vs. Hyper-V keyboards.  Please see <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/forcing-a-system-crash-from-the-keyboard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not sure which location to use: It's okay to create the same value in all three locations.</p>
<h3>Reboot first</h3>
<p>You must reboot your machine in order to make the Registry setting take effect.</p>
<h3>Use the rightmost Ctrl key</h3>
<p>Before pressing Scroll lock twice, you must hold down the <strong>rightmost</strong> Ctrl key.</p>
<p>Do not use the other Ctrl key; it won't work.</p>
<h3>Possible workarounds</h3>

<pre class=""lang-yaml prettyprint-override""><code>---
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    a_string: abcd1234
    a_list: ['a', 'short', 'list']

  tasks:
  - debug:

        [
          &quot;a_string length: {{ a_string | length }}&quot;,
          &quot;a_list length: {{ a_list | length }}&quot;,
          &quot;a_dict length: {{ a_dict | length }}&quot;
        ]
</code></pre>
<p>And the result:</p>
<pre><code>PLAY [localhost] ******************************************************************************************************************************

TASK [debug] **********************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost] =&gt; {
    &quot;msg&quot;: [
        &quot;a_string length: 8&quot;,
        &quot;a_list length: 3&quot;,

<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>{% if my_value is string %}
  1
{% elif my_value is iterable %}
  {{ my_value | length }}

<p>We have to check if it's a string <em>first</em> as strings are also iterable, whereas dictionaries (mapping) and lists (sequences) are not strings. Integers and Floats don't have a &quot;length&quot; property, so perhaps you should check for that first too (using <code>if my_value is number</code>)?</p>

<p>Your BIOS has tables which are evaluated by Linux during boot. Very often, those tables don't follow the ACPI standard, which nobody notices on Windows because the Vendor who wrote the tables also supply their own Windows driver which work with those tables.</p>
<p>However, there's no driver for Linux, so Linux has to somehow interpret even buggy tables.</p>
<p>The ACPI BIOS you are seeing may or may not be harmful, and may have been already present before the update. It also may be the cause of the hang.</p>

<p>How to remove the Meet Now icon on Windows 10
Meet Now is useful to a subset of users. If you don't plan to use it, you may want to remove it from the taskbar as it takes up space without providing anything of use to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple options are available to remove Meet Now from the system. One of the easier options involves right-clicking on the Meet Now icon and selecting &quot;hide&quot; from the context menu that opens. Doing so removes the Meet Now icon from the Windows 10 taskbar.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another option that you have is to open the Settings application on the system, e.g. by using the shortcut Windows-I, or by selecting Start &gt; Settings, going to Personalization &gt; Taskbar, selecting &quot;turn system icons on or off&quot;, and toggling &quot;Meet Now&quot; on the page that opens to off. You may restore Meet Now at anytime using the Settings app, but need to make sure the feature is set to on this time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Removing Meet Now via the Group Policy
System administrators may disable (or enable) the Meet Now icon on the Windows 10 taskbar using the Group Policy. The Group Policy is only available in professional editions of Windows 10, and not in Windows 10 Home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is how that is done:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You need elevated rights to use the Group Policy.
Use Windows-R to open the runbox.
Type gpedit.msc and select OK.
Go to User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar
Double-click on &quot;Remove the Meet Now icon&quot;.
Set the feature to &quot;Enabled&quot; to hide the icon on the taskbar of the Windows 10 operating system.
Restart the PC.
Removing Meet Now using the Registry
You may also remove Meet Now on Windows 10 using the Registry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Use Windows-R to open the runbox.
Type regedit.exe and select OK.
For individual users, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
Right-click on Explorer and select New &gt; Dword (32-bit) Value.
Name it HideSCAMeetNow.
Set its value to 1.
For all users, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer

This plugin also provides you a per-slave &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; script configuration specific for on-demand slaves. This probably exactly fits your needs.</p>

<p>Once installed, you will have an additional &quot;Launch method&quot; (1) for
this case:</p>
<p>this one lets you specify the &quot;Start&quot; (2) and &quot;Stop&quot; (3) scripts, and
on top of that you will be able to specify the &quot;conventional&quot;
connection (4) method for reaching the slave after it has been
started.</p>
<p>You will likely also want to specify that you want this node to be
online only when Jenkins needs it (5).</p>

<p><strong>Steps to set it up (on windows).</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Download the jar file from here <a href=""https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar</a> and save it anywhere in your <strong>C:/</strong> drive, let's say under a folder named <code>antlr</code>, i.e., C:/antlr/ (my case I simply named the folder antlr, refer image below)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWQz1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWQz1.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>STEP2:</strong> Create a <code>.bat</code> file named <code>antlr4.bat</code> and put the following content in it.</p>
<pre><code>java org.antlr.v4.Tool %*
</code></pre>
<p>(refer point 2 in above image I have kept the antlr.bat in the same folder as my jar, refer the image below to see the content of the bat file)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2n5t.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2n5t.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Similarly create one more <code>.bat</code> file named <code>grun.bat</code> and put in the same folder as the jar with the content.</p>
<pre><code>java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig %*
</code></pre>
<p>(refer the images)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now add the CLASSPATH variable in system variable, with value as the complete path to the jar file downloaded in step 1 above.
For my case it would be <code>C:\antlr\antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar</code> as I have put the downloaded jar file in C:/antlr.

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> I also added the path where I have put the .bat files added in STEP2 and 3 in the PATH system variable.
(refer image, how I added the path which is C:/antlr in my case where I have those bat files present)</p>

<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>You have display scaling enabled, so that things on your screen aren't tiny despite pixels being much smaller physically. Display scaling needs special support in programs to work correctly.</p>
<p>Programs that are scaling-aware will take advantage of scaling. Others draw their window in a buffer as if scaling was disabled and Windows upscales them afterwards. The result is similar to zooming in on a photo, they become blurry.</p>
<p>You can disable scaling on per-application basis in properties of the EXE or a shortcut, on the <em>Compatibility</em> tab. You can also disable it altogether for entire system in <em>Display settings</em>. This will increase available screen area at the cost of everything getting smaller.</p>

1607129,2020-12-03 19:15:19.483,0,"<p>I've edited the title of your question, because standard delete refers to deleting a file which is less worse than a format. However, deleting a partition is worse than a format.</p>
<p>The difference is:</p>
<p>You have an allocated space called partition, and you can format that in different layouts. Format clears the partition, but delete partition removes the partition alltogether, turning it into unallocated space. If you delete multiple partitions, the new unallocated space will not be segmented. If you want to restore the partition, you have to recreate it. If you want it to be the same size as it was, then it helps to know what it was.</p>
<p>Recovering a formatted drive is easier than recovering a deleted partition. Most software can recover a formatted drive if you don't do anything with it since the format, but a deleted partition may require special tools and skills.</p>
<p>Deleting just one partition, and recreating it is not that hard though.</p>
<p>That said, you are in the Windows Setup screen, and if you go for either format or delete, it seems you do not have any sensitive data on the disk anyway. If you are considering repartitioning the entire drive to make windows use all of the space, the easiest trick is to delete all partitions, and then select the unallocated empty space and just install to that. Windows setup will then create 4 partitions. 1 big partition for your C and 3 for recovery purposes. That is the best practice, but it means you have to have backups before doing this, as the drives will be empty afterwards.</p>

Fundamentally, a partition is just an entry in a table with start and end points (and some other stuff).</p>

If you have another drive that is the exact same size as the source, you can also clone the drive (somewhat like <code>dd if=/dev/md1 of=/dev/sdx …</code>), but take extra care not to accidentally overwrite the wrong drive! If you have another storage location with enough free space, you can just store the backup in a file (as described above).</p>
<p>You can use virtually any live Linux (Ubuntu, …) because they all contain tools like <code>dd</code> and <code>fdisk</code>. You’ll have to download Testdisk, but that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: You mention the partitions were encrypted using VeraCrypt. This makes recovery very difficult. Testdisk cannot find partition boundaries with VeraCrypt, only with older TrueCrypt volumes. You’ll have to do everything by hand.</p>
<p>You have to guess where the first partition started (maybe at sector 2048). Create a single partition spanning the entire drive. You may then be able to mount it using VeraCrypt (preferably read-only) and, if successful, you might be able to determine the partition size. If not, try elsewhere.</p>
<p>With the partition size in hand you would then have a rough position of where the second partition starts. Repeat the same process.</p>

<p>It seems like a significant number of people (Raven and our very own @chriss included) have said that it's because the phone is on the same channel as the router. While it is true that this <em><strong>should not be the case</strong></em> as routers can and should be able to handle devices on the same/close channels without anything but minor performance hits, it seems that smartphones are sometimes an exception.</p>
<p>In fact, I also had this issue and I used a WiFi analyzer tool to find a channel that worked better and that solved my problem back in 2018 at my old place.</p>
<p>Note that this may have been a symptom and not the issues. It's possible that the channel was having issues by itself and my smartphone was just the last straw that cuased the network to fail. Either way, changing the channel did fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Another experience I had</strong> more recently presented similar issues but was rooted from a different issue. Whenever I got home, internet would go out. In this case, even wired devices went out so it was not related to the channel. It turned out that the coaxal connection had issues with it and there was a filter in the line outside that comcast had thrown in as a temporary fix and forgotten about it. After a storm knocked out power and internet, they rediscovered the issue and fixed it, resulting in the problem being solved.</p>
<p>Not sure which it is for you (or anyone else having this issue and coming here), but I recommend having your ISP come test your coaxal connection. Honestly I recommend everyone do this every decade or so and when moving into a new place.</p>

1607183,2020-12-03 23:56:03.380,1,"<p>I realise this post is several months old, but I've also invested in a dual WAN setup at home since I've nearly been working at home a year now and my local cable provider has very regular outages/slowness etc, but when it works, it's amazingly fast. But when you have no internet, you can't work and as a contractor that means I don't get paid.</p>
<p>So I found a 4G router being sold with an unlimited data SIM by a network in the UK called three and it was pretty cheap. I already have cable internet. So I built a pfSense firewall (free software) and bought a 4 port gigabit network card for very cheap.</p>
<p>I've now got my home setup such that if my main internet connection dies, or has packet loss, it will swap over to the 4G connection (in around about 1-2 seconds) and all the devices in the house use that without reconfiguring anything you just have to wait a couple of seconds and normal service is resumed.</p>
<p>I don't have to do anything special in terms of DHCP, one DHCP server (the pfSense box) hands out all my IP addresses then pfSense figures out which gateway to send the traffic to.</p>
<p>Now I can suffer the loss of either WAN link and still be online. I used an old computer from 5 years ago as the router, and I paid around about £50 (about $70 USD) for the 4 port gigabit card. My WiFi also routes to pfSense so all wireless devices continue to work. It's very much set and forget too, I like to poke around at it but equally i've left it for months at a time without having to do anything (and i've never ever had to reset it).</p>
<p>There are of course hardware routers that can do failover/multi-wan. I've used the edgerouter-x ($60 gigabit router with 5 ports) and it has pretty good failover too, you could do the same here with one ISP in one ethernet port and another ISP / 4G in the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other address representations were in common use when classful networking was practiced. For example, the loopback address 127.0.0.1 is commonly written as 127.1, given that it belongs to a class-A network with eight bits for the network mask and 24 bits for the host number. When fewer than four numbers are specified in the address in dotted notation, the last value is treated as an integer of as many bytes as are required to fill out the address to four octets. Thus, the address 127.65530 is equivalent to 127.0.255.250.</p>

In a misguided attempt to make them more human-readable, they are traditionally displayed in the UI in &quot;dotted decimal&quot; notation, where each octet (8-bit byte), starting with the most significant, is represented as a decimal number, separated from the next octet by a dot.</p>
<p>It's not terribly surprising that some UIs might allow you to input anything they can interpret as a UInt32 and use the resulting UInt32 as the IPv4 address you intended.</p>

1607231,2020-12-04 05:52:41.960,0,"<p><strong>&quot;.0&quot; can be omitted conditionally</strong></p>
<p>You often use the &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; command to do a loop test on the machine to verify whether the TCP/IP protocol suite of the machine is correctly installed. But did you find it? The same test result can be obtained by using the command &quot;ping 127.1&quot;. In fact, the two commands &quot;ping 127.1&quot; and &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; are the same, both of which are performing loop tests.</p>
<p>Why is this so? This is the skill of using IP address in Ping command application. Everyone knows that the IP address is composed of 32 binary digits. In order to make it easier for everyone to remember, every 8 binary digits are converted into decimal digits. Therefore, an easy-to-remember IP address consisting of four-part decimal digits (such as 127.0.0.1 ). Since the Windows operating system has the function of automatically filling &quot;.0&quot;, I can change &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; to &quot;127.1&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the omission of this &quot;.0&quot; is conditionally restricted and cannot be omitted arbitrarily. In the application of the Ping command, you can only omit one or more &quot;.0&quot;s that appear before the last decimal number of the IP address, such as rewriting the &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; command to &quot;ping 127.1&quot;.</p>
<p>If the one or more &quot;.0&quot; is not next to the last part of the decimal number, but in other positions, then this &quot;.0&quot; cannot be omitted, such as &quot;ping 202.0.96.1&quot; cannot be written as &quot;ping 202.96.1&quot; &quot;. This is because the result returned by &quot;ping 202.96.1&quot; is the response message of &quot;202.96.0.1&quot; instead of the response message of &quot;202.0.96.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Number string instead of IP address</strong></p>
<p>In the Ping command, you can also use a numeric string instead of an IP address. Run the &quot;ping 3658906394&quot; command, and you will see the return information of the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot;.</p>
<p>Why is this so? In fact, &quot;3658906394&quot; is another representation of the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot;. Of course, you can also ping other IP addresses in the same way.</p>
<p>How is the string converted? In fact, it is not complicated. Taking the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; as an example, the method of converting the IP address into a numeric string is as follows: first convert &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; to hexadecimal &quot;DA.16.7B.1A&quot;, and then remove it. After the decimal point, it becomes &quot;DA167B1A&quot;, and finally the hexadecimal number is converted to decimal &quot;3658906394&quot;, then &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; becomes &quot;3658906394&quot;. The same method is used to convert other IP addresses into numeric strings.</p>
<p>Tip: In some LAN environments, using the &quot;Ping+number string&quot; command may fail, and the prompt message &quot;Unknown host number string&quot; appears. This is because the number string is resolved into a host name instead of an IP address.</p>

<p>The VPN Server receives the packet and modifies the source / destination ip address to point to the actual web server hosted on the same network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shouldn't ever be needed, because the client has already specified the destination IP address they want. (VPNs <em>encapsulate</em> the original packet inside another IP packet, without altering the original IP header, so the server only needs to decapsulate it again and forward the original packet exactly as it was.)</p>
<p>NAT can be done (and is occassionally done), but it's more often the OS firewall's job and the sysadmin's decision – it shouldn't be done by the VPN software all on its own.

<p>Typically, the VPN server will have a virtual interface exactly like the VPN client and will use exactly the same mechanisms to produce and receive packets.

<p>But as I see it, a &quot;bridge&quot; is kinda the same as a VLAN. The VLAN itself can't do anything. For different machines to communicate over that bridge/VLAN  they need to connect to it via ports. So imagine a bridge as physical Layer 2 switch/hub and ports as, well, ports on that switch. A switch without ports is useless, and the only way to connect to this switch is through ports.</p>
<p>Regarding your first question:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Intel and AMD CPUs in desktop and laptop computers, if properly installed, cooled, not overclocked, and not subject to electrical problems like a bad power supply, will last a very long time even if all cores are constantly 100% utilized--such that you don't usually have to worry about &quot;wearing out&quot; your CPU.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore, even from the first PC's of the early 80's, disk drives used something called Direct Memory Access (DMA).  Floppy drives have used DMA since the first PC, and hard drives started to have DMA modes probably sometime in the late 80's.</p>
<p>DMA basically allows drives to transfer data to and from RAM without the CPU in the middle.  So hard drive transfers have even less of a CPU impact than you might think.</p>
<p>Where the CPU might still be in the middle is if you have disk encryption running on your system, such as Bitlocker, TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt, or other.  But it's still not going to be anything to worry about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are causing an HDD hard drive (not an SSD) to work harder by copying from it constantly.  You are adding wear to an SDD by copying <em>to</em> it.  Spinning-rust HDDs and even SSDs do have a finite lifetime that is likely less than your CPU.</p>

<p>1a. CPUs are not heavily involved in file copies - The CPU's job is to tell the other hardware to do the transfer, and the actual transfer of 1's and 0's is left to other chipsets/IO's to do.</p>
<p>1b. Even if a file transfer did use a lot of CPU, CPUs have incredibly good longevity and usually processors don't fail or go bad - they <em>do</em> get replaced regularly due to being outdated - which speaks to the fact of its longevity - a CPU will outlive its efficiency lifespan.</p>
<p><strong>Damage to HDD - Still minimal, but worth considering</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using an HDD wears an HDD. It has moving parts, so the more they're used, the more potential for damage from wear - but if you can't use it it's useless anyway. The best practice for HDDs is to know that at some point, it <strong>will</strong> fail and to have backups - this is the only real protection you have against HDD failure - backups.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You <em>can</em> reduce the wear and tear on the HDD by ensuring that you run a single copy command at any given time (which is what I suspect is the typical method), so whether you do a drag &amp; drop or a command line like <code>robocopy</code>, make sure you only do one of this actions and let it complete before starting another one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Your specific questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>No, you will not affect your CPU in a negative way, in fact you can open task manager during this and probably witness your CPU not go over 20% usage, depending on what else your computer is doing in the background.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No, all CPUs are built to be robust - a 3rd gen i7 vs an 8th gen i9, or a Ryzen7, what have you, is engineered to last and endure utilization far above what a file transfer will do to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No, this would not be a helpful method to reduce the damage that we've already stated is negligible. Even if your CPU isn't properly cooled, this low utilization should not make it overheat - and if it does, its performance will only be affected while it's too hot - its lifetime performance/longevity will not be affected by overheating.</p>

<p>I had the same issue on an older Lenovo Z710 Ideapad after a full reset of Windows. The &quot;IDT High Definition Audio CODEC&quot; had a yellow sign, and I could not get any sound.

</ul>
<p>While the accepted solution of 2016 asks you to update with the choice &quot;IDT High Definition Audio CODEC&quot; at this point, surprisingly, this has turned out wrong in my case. Against any intuition, you must not choose the driver with the same name like the device! Instead, you need to strictly follow the Lenovo guide and really install the &quot;High Definition audio controller&quot;. You must ignore the warning message that it is recommended not to install this device driver since it cannot be assured that it is compatible with the hardware.</p>

1607419,2020-12-04 20:40:56.857,0,"<p>This is an apparent bug with the gcc-10 packages in Debian: they renamed a package and removed the transitional packages before the release of Bullseye. The following packages were renamed (to match stated convention/debian policy more closely, I think):</p>
<ul>
<li>libgcc1 -&gt; libgcc-s1</li>
<li>lib64gcc1 -&gt; lib64gcc-s1 (on 32 bit architectures only)</li>
<li>lib32gcc1 -&gt; lib32gcc-s1 (on 64 bit architectures only)</li>
<li>libx32gcc1 -&gt; libx32gcc-s1 (on x86_64 only)</li>
<li>a few others on less common arches</li>
</ul>
<p>The newly-renamed packages have a <code>Provides: libgcc1</code> (etc.) property, but it
appears that apt is preferring a real (old) libgcc1 package over a virtual
package that is only &quot;provide&quot;d by the newer package, since it's trying to not
break your system. I am not familiar with the details of the internals of
dependency resolution and installation order, but that's how I understand the
problem anyway.</p>
<p>The way to really solve the problem, at least until a fix in the distro, is to provide &quot;real&quot; (but empty &quot;transitional&quot;) packages named using the old name, that depend on the package's new name. I have done this over at <a href=""https://salsa.debian.org/rpavlik/gcc-10-compat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://salsa.debian.org/rpavlik/gcc-10-compat</a> (including a repo to add with the packages). There's more details about the problem, and instructions to use my workaround, over there.</p>
<p>Since I know link-only answers are frowned upon, here's approximately what my workaround effectively does:</p>
<p>You can use the <code>equivs</code> package to make your own empty packages. (You may need to do this on a different system or undo your repo changes, to be able to install equivs!) Once <code>equivs</code> is installed, you'll want to do something like this for each of the package renames:</p>
<pre><code># create equivs control file named libgcc1
equivs-control libgcc1.control

# edit equivs control file: you will need to set:
# - &quot;Package&quot; name to the old name
# - &quot;Version&quot; to something larger than the old version: 10.1.0-1 works
# - &quot;Depends&quot; to the new name
nano libgcc1.control

# Build a package - add `--arch i386` to make a 32-bit build
equivs-build libgcc1.control
</code></pre>
<p>You will then need to put this into an apt repo: <strong>do not</strong> just install it directly because these will replace the essential, real libgcc, which will keep you from running apt! Making a repo is beyond the scope here, check another question or just use the repo I already made.</p>
<p>Once these new &quot;transitional&quot; libgcc1 etc. are available in an apt repo and you update your sources to choose bullseye, apt will be able to dist-upgrade/full-upgrade correctly, and you can remove the transitional packages after the upgrade is done.</p>

1607428,2020-12-04 21:13:52.397,0,"<p>I present media content every week. My approach to avoiding gray rectangles and making the user experience relatively seamless is two-fold.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Show media using PowerPoint</strong> if possible. When showing images and video, I almost always do so as part of a PowerPoint presentation. Using PowerPoint animations, I can control exactly what the audience sees in Slideshow mode without my audience ever having to see the player itself nor my mouse clicking on player controls, for example. I insert each image or video using the Link-to-File insertion option (keeping media from getting stored within the PowerPoint file itself and making the file size huge). For a video, I go to the Playback ribbon and set the Start option to Automatically and usually check the Play Full Screen box. (If I have other content showing on the screen, such as an overlay title in a text box, then I just manually size the video to fit the slide and don't check the Play Full Screen box, as Full Screen mode will bring the video to the front and hide all other content.) When I advance to the slide, the video automatically starts playing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use a second monitor</strong>. If you can attach a second monitor to your computer and extend your desktop to it, avoiding gray boxes gets much easier. I have Zoom and everything else playing in my main screen, so that's where notifications and such will pop up. I play the PowerPoint slideshow on the second monitor in full-screen mode, and typically start the slideshow before the call. When it's time to share, I select the PowerPoint slideshow as what I'll be sharing, and optimize video and share system sound. With any other apps appearing only on the first monitor, no gray boxes ever appear over the slideshow content on the second monitor.</p>
</li>

<p>What you see looks fine to me.</p>
<p>I have a Kali machine in VMware Workstation plus a couple of other machines. Each machine is assigned 3 GB (so 9 GB total).</p>
<p>But the total amount of VMware memory is more in Task Manager because of VMware usage. About 10 GB total (varies a bit up and down).</p>
<p><strong>Follow up:</strong>  Updates in Virtual Machines consume memory that may or may not be released. So yesterday, 10 GB used, machines all updated, and then today (fresh start up, same machines running), 8 to 9 GB used.  So as I noted earlier, it will vary up and down.</p>

1607444,2020-12-04 22:54:56.730,0,"<p>It's a bit hackish, but I think you could manage it by using multiple users with the same uid. You could would have on <code>/etc/passwd</code>:</p>

HumanA:x:1000:1000::/home/machine:/bin/bash

<p>The system actually identifies the users by their uid. So, with a setup like this, you can enter both HumanA (with HumanA's password) or HumanN (with HumanB's password), and you will end up at the same session. It will however log the user provided for login.</p>
<p>When the system wants to resolve uid 1000 to a name, it will find the first resullt and just return &quot;Appliance&quot;.</p>

1607450,2020-12-04 23:39:12.720,3,"<p>Temporarily change your computer's netmask to a wider one, e.g. 255.255.0.0 will do the job.</p>
<p>It's <strong>not</strong> addresses which end in 255 that are 'broadcast' – it is the <em>last address of the subnet</em> that is 'broadcast'. That is, subnets larger than /24 will have plenty of normal addresses ending in 255, while subnets smaller than /24 will have broadcast addresses which <em>don't</em> end in 255, it all depends on the netmask being used.</p>
<p>So if you use 255.255.0.0 (aka /16) as the netmask, then only <code>x.y.255.255</code> will be the broadcast address and x.y.2.255 will not be.</p>

    ROOTKEY  [ HKLM | HKCU | HKCR | HKU | HKCC ]
    SubKey   The full name of a registry key under the selected ROOTKEY.

  FileName   The name of the disk file to export.

  /y       Force overwriting the existing file without prompt.

  /reg:32  Specifies the key should be accessed using the 32-bit registry view.
