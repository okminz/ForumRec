<ol>
<li><p>It seems you have a typo in your config file as <code>HndleLidSwitch=ignore</code> where it should be <code>HandleLidSwitch=ignore</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is likely the issue with that parameter not being parsed correctly so I'd start by getting this corrected first in case it's as simple as that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore, as per <a href=""https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/logind.conf.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">logind.conf, logind.conf.d — Login manager configuration files</a> as few key things to note that I read:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Only input devices with the &quot;power-switch&quot; udev tag will be watched for key/lid switch events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the system is inserted in a docking station, or if more than one display is connected, the action specified by <code>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</code>
occurs; if the system is on external power the action (if any)
specified by <code>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</code> occurs; otherwise the
<code>HandleLidSwitch=</code> action occurs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A different application <strong>may disable logind's handling of system power and sleep keys and the lid switch</strong> by taking a low-level inhibitor lock (&quot;handle-power-key&quot;, &quot;handle-suspend-key&quot;, &quot;handle-hibernate-key&quot;, &quot;handle-lid-switch&quot;, &quot;handle-reboot-switch&quot;).</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <strong>most commonly used by graphical desktop environments to take over suspend and hibernation handling, and to use their own configuration mechanisms.</strong> If a low-level inhibitor lock is taken, logind will not take any action when that key or switch is triggered and the Handle*= settings are irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Additionally according to a comment on the <a href=""https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11638"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HandleLidSwitch in /etc/systemd/logind.conf is ignored</a> post:</p>

1606328,1,2020-12-01 00:43:37.633,0,"<p>I have a very quick question regarding the IO shield in my PC build. I'm a complete beginner when it comes to this, so this might be a silly question. I've recently started building a computer but I've hit a bit of an issue that's taken me around in circles.</p>
<p>The case I've got is a Obsidian 500D case and the motherboard I have is a MSI MPG Z490. I've installed the CPU, RAM and SSD on to the board no problem, but I've had an issue with screwing the board into the case itself.</p>
<p>The reason I bought the case was because it supported this motherboard (I used the site pcpartpicker.com to confirm this). When I go to place the motherboard in the case, the screw holes in the board don't fully align with the standoffs on the case. I've try wiggling the board around to try and see if I can align it, but to no avail.</p>
<p>But funnily enough, I removed the IO-shield from the motherboard (It came pre-attached to it) and tried again with aligning the board. And, it aligned perfectly. With no problems at all. My question is, is this normal? Surely it should just fit on without having to go through the need to remove the IO-shield? That's needed, right?</p>
<p>I've also tried taking the IO-shield off, placing it in the case, then attaching the motherboard but it doesn't align (like before). Although, the IO-shield doesn't snap into place when I put it in the case. After looking online most other builds I've seen have the IO-shield snap into place, so perhaps I'm being too gentle? One thing I did note was that the IO-shield seems to be a little too thin, i.e. it could be moved a little bit left and right in the slot (which I assume comes from it not being snapped into place?)</p>

<p>To validate, unplug everything inside the case until you have just the motherboard and PSU. Power on and see what happens. If it powers on, add a screen and GPU if there is no builtin graphics, check again. Repeat until it no longer powers on to find the culprit.</p>

<p>No, efibootmgr just points UEFI to an EFI file</p>

<p>how do I make or get an EFI file?</p>

<p>One way to do it is to use GRUB as described here: <a href=""https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/</a></p>
<p>Which tells us we need <code>grub</code> and <code>efibootmgr</code> installed, and an EFI partition mounted. Then issue this command:</p>

<p>Where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is just the label that will appear when listing the EFI priority with efibootmgr. The command will generate an EFI file on the EFI partition and modify the EFI boot priority to point to that EFI file. The last step is to generate a grub config file.</p>
<p>Note that GRUB is a very flexible boot loader and using it to generate EFI files is just one of the many functions. The default use case for grub appears to be with BIOS instead of UEFI which is why it took me quite some time to find this invocation.</p>

I unfortunately didn't realize I had selected the wrong format (I think UEFI is the acronym?).

<p>So I unplugged the USB stick as instructed on screen, and then restarted that machine.  Bringing the stick back to my main machine, it is now non-existant to anything that can recover the drive.  It's visible under Device Manager as &quot;USB Mass Storage Device&quot;, and even Avast asks if I want to scan it for malware.  I can go to it by typing in &quot;E:&quot; in my file browser, but it is just completely blank with no files.</p>
<p>I cannot reformat it, as no actual program I've used detects its existence, and the USB stick is basically just...gone.  Even Rufus itself can no longer detect the USB stick, even with the &quot;List USB Hard Drives&quot; option.

<p>At a guess, because you haven't set up the NUC web server to be a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reverse proxy</a> (i.e. to forward web requests, based on your Dynamic DNS domain for the Raspberry Pi, to your Raspberry Pi itself).</p>
<p>Typically, only one web server can be associated with an IP address at a time (independent of Dynamic DNS names). So when an external request (e.g. 4G) for ex.<code> mypi.noip.com</code> is received by your NUC, it likely simply drops it. You need to explicitly tell the NUC web server software to pass requests for ex.<code> mypi.noip.com</code> to the Raspberry Pi on your local network. The NUC would then return any messages from the Raspberry Pi (e.g. a web page) to any external client.</p>

However, in general, low-end consumer routers' &quot;DMZs&quot; typically place a given device &quot;outside&quot; your router's firewall settings (your router firewall settings no longer have any affect on the device). This has the advantage that you no longer need to set up ex. port forwarding. That said, it generally has the disadvantage that <em>all</em> incoming requests are sent to that device.

<ol>
<li>The VPS in question mostly serves as an OpenVPN server. I would like to have the Matrix homeserver only accessible from clients connected to the VPN. To the OpenVPN clients, the server is accessible by IP at 192.168.xxx.1. Clients connect to the VPN by IP; there is no <em>externally</em> accessible FQDN associated with it. Is this going to be a problem? N.B. the VPN clients typically use the DNS server (Pi-hole) running on the VPS, which does allow them to reach the server by its hostname. Can I just use this hostname as the domain namee for Synapse and mautrix-whatsapp?</li>
<li>Port 443 is NOT available, because I redirect it to 1194 so clients can connect to the VPN on restrictive public networks.

Is that correct?</li>
<li>In fact, since the client connections will already be encrypted by virtue of OpenVPN, could I forgo the reverse proxy entirely? If so, is that sensible, and is there anything I need to know w.r.t. configuration, etc?</li>

What happens is the uninstaller removes the PATH entry of the <code>dotnet</code> executable, even the one by other .NET installations, so VS cannot find it. If that is the case, if you type in <code>where dotnet</code> in the terminal, you won't get anything. Find the path to <code>dotnet.exe</code> manually (usually <code>C:\Program Files\dotnet</code>) and add it to PATH. Check in Control Panel whether there is a version actually installed. Make sure to log off and log in again, otherwise it won't work even if you restart VS.</p>

<p>I know the problem isn't with the hard drive nor the USB 3.0 SATA connector. I copied a big file from the hard drive back to the hard drive itself and was getting around 80 MiB/sec. I also ran hdparm and it had a read value also around 80 MiB/sec. I checked the ethernet connection and it is connected with 100 Mbps link. When I ran speed test to the internet (just to check if I'm getting that 100 Mbps on the network), it did gave me values close to 100 Mbps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So &quot;on paper&quot;, everything seems to look great. However, when I'm trying to move files from my HDD to the SSD, I'm only getting about 50-70 MB/s. I assumed that the bottleneck here is the speed limit of the HDD read access...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s exactly right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I don't understand is why this bogs down my whole system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is because you are loading the disk <em>100%</em>. It is squeezing out every bit of read speed it can offer. The target drive is just <em>so much faster</em>.</p>
<p>Windows will start to hang a lot when the system drive (and perhaps drives with page files) is excessively loaded, because it now competes for I/O bandwidth. Even if Windows inserts its own I/O operations into the queue, the drive is still super busy in total. In fact, on a mechanical hard drive, more seeking will reduce performance even further.</p>
<p>All this is much less severe on SSDs, because they offer vastly superior random access performance (well over 100 times faster on decent SSDs), even compared to the fastest enterprise HDDs. That means equal distribution of I/O bandwidth is much more feasible.</p>
<p>You absolutely should migrate your operating system to the SSD. You can still use separate partitions for Windows and whatever other data you have.</p>
<p>Maybe just get another SSD because you will not want to use your HDD anymore.</p>

1606494,2,2020-12-01 16:08:43.600,1,"<p>There are a couple ways.</p>
<p>One way is to set all your Page Margins to 0 (if your printer cannot print all the way to the edge you will get a warning that it is outside the printable area), set the Table width to 100% or however many inches wide the page is, then set the row height to the height of the page (I like to set &quot;Row height is&quot; to &quot;Exactly&quot; instead of &quot;At least&quot; and also un-check &quot;Allow row to break across pages&quot; they're not necessary but may help). Now you should have a single cell table that fully covers the page. If you need multiple columns or rows you'll need to either split the table and figure out the measurements for each column and row to maintain full coverage or create a nested table.</p>
<p>Another way is to change the Table's Text Wrapping option to &quot;Around&quot; which (if you know HTML) is very similar to floating the table so you can &quot;break out&quot; of containers. Then click the &quot;Positioning...&quot; button and set them as shown in my attached image. The important settings on the Table Positioning are the &quot;Realitive to&quot; options, you want those set to &quot;Page&quot; and the distance all set to 0. Then same as the first method, set the Table width to the width of the page and the row height to the height of the page.</p>
<p>Note: It can be a little cumbersome getting the heights and widths just right especially when you start adding content and breaking up cells, but you can get it there adjusting the heights of the rows and widths of the table/columns. If you are planning to have this table as the only thing in your document, Word, for whatever reason, forces a new line at the end of the document. You may get stuck with a blank page at the end. I can sometimes get around that by setting the new line's paragraph settings to have no spacing and the smallest font possible and make my table height just a little less to allow the newline room on the first page.</p>

<p>I am assuming without evidence that you are using Word for Windows, not on a Mac. The structural changes are the same on a Mac but the controls are a bit different. You are dealing with <a href=""http://word.mvps.org/faqs/formatting/workwithsections.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Section Properties</a> and with <a href=""http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Recap_of_Header/Footer_settings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Headers and Footers</a> which are a part of Section Properties.</p>

</ul>
<h2>In the Middle of a Document With Other Text</h2>
<p>If your table is in other text and you want to have normal margins for that other text, you will need to set your document up to have page SECTION breaks around it. This is done under the Layout Tab. Before your table: Breaks &gt; Next Page and after Breaks &gt; Next Page.</p>
<p>Then in the Headers and Footers Tab make sure your headers and footers are not &quot;Linked to Previous.&quot; Do this for both the header and footer. This should be done in the section that contains your table and the following section. Then make the changes to the headers and footers in the section that contains your table without changing others.</p>
<h2>Header and Footer Size - Do this after adding section breaks!</h2>
<p>While you cannot remove headers and footers in Word <em>(they are a part of the document structure)</em>, you can shrink them. This can be done in the Header/Footer Tab or in the Page Layout dialog. You can change the distance reserved to .1.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLoET.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLoET.png"" alt=""Controls on Header/Footer Tab"" /></a></p>
<p>Note that each header and footer has an <em>empty paragraph</em> in it. You can see these by displaying non-printing formatting marks. While you cannot delete those empty paragraphs, you can also shrink them. Go into each header and footer. Use Ctrl+A to select all text and then change the font size to 1 point. (You have to type the 1.)</p>
<p>Your header and footer may also have paragraph spacing set for space before or space after. This is paragraph formatting and can be changed in the Format Paragraph dialog that you can reach by clicking on the Dialog Launcher (little arrow in the bottom right of the Paragraph Group).</p>
<h2>Final Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any change in the Printer Driver being used changes the printable area. This may be different on different computers even if they are using the same printer.</li>
<li>Page numbering gets trickier with multiple sections. See my writing on <a href=""http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#PageNumbers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Page Numbering in Word</a>.</li>

<p>Nowadays <code>sh</code> is <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/98912/108618"">not necessarily the legacy Bourne shell</a>. Nowadays <code>sh</code> is a shell that supports <em>at least</em> the features required by POSIX (assuming a correct implementation). POSIX specifies the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sh</code> utility</a> and the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/shell.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shell Command Language</a>.</p>
<p>I assume you want your code to work in a POSIX shell and to be portable in general.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p><a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/278465/108618""><code>dd ibs=1 count=…</code> is a POSIX way to read an exact number of bytes</a>. It seems to be the only portable command line utility that can do the job reliably. But <code>dd</code> reads bytes, while <code>read -n</code> in Bash reads <em>characters</em>. <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html#tag_06_02"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">POSIX allows multi-byte characters in locales other than <code>POSIX</code></a>. Even if you run the entire script with <code>LC_ALL=POSIX</code>, the terminal (terminal emulator) may still generate a multi-byte sequence upon some single keystroke. Such sequence may not be a multi-byte character; it may be an escape sequence (<a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/211923/108618"">e.g. for <kbd>F1</kbd></a>, also see <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/116630/108618"">this answer</a>).</p>
<p>After you read just one byte, the rest will remain and it will be read by anything that tries to read from the terminal later (it may be a part of your script or the interactive shell you run the script from).</p>
<p>Additionally if you run sole <code>dd ibs=1 count=1</code> then you will most likely discover that nothing gets to <code>dd</code> until you exceed <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html#tag_11_01_05"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>{MAX_INPUT}</code> or <code>{MAX_CANON}</code></a>, or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/110248/108618""><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd></a> (and in case of <code>count</code> being more than <code>1</code>, if you want to provide less bytes then you may need to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/21261742/10765659"">twice</a>).</p>
<p>To deal with these issues you need the <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html#tag_11_01_07"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-canonical mode</a>. Use <a href=""https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/stty.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>stty -icanon</code></a>. In general starting with <code>stty raw</code> looks like a good idea.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The following example is a proof of concept. Because it manipulates line settings of the terminal and reads from the terminal <strong>you <em>must not</em> paste it into an interactive shell, this won't work</strong>. Paste it into a file and run the file.</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>#!/bin/sh

echo &quot;Press any key to continue.&quot;

saveterm=&quot;$(stty -g)&quot;                     # save terminal state
stty raw
stty -echo -icanon min 1 time 0           # prepare to read one byte
dd ibs=1 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null   # read one byte
stty -icanon min 0 time 0                 # prepare to read lefotvers
while read none; do :; done               # read leftovers
stty $saveterm                            # restore terminal state
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The script doesn't check if its stdin is a terminal, but in general it should (<a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/401938/108618""><code>[ -t 0 ]</code></a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a sane setup a modifier key (e.g. <kbd>Shift</kbd>), when pressed alone, sends no input to whatever reads from the terminal; therefore our code will not register such key as &quot;any key&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;read leftovers&quot; trick is taken from <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/1268886/432690"">this answer</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thanks to <code>stty raw</code> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> can be &quot;any key&quot; as well, instead of sending <code>SIGINT</code> or <code>SIGSTOP</code> respectively. Still the shell interpreting the script may get a signal from elsewhere, so in general it may happen it exits before it gets to <code>stty $saveterm</code>; so it may happen it leaves the terminal in a state not suitable for interactive use. You may want to trap relevant signals and restore the initial state of the terminal anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's true <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/131767/108618"">one should double-quote variables</a> in general. Here <code>$saveterm</code> is deliberately not quoted because <code>stty -g</code> generates output that is unspecified. Implementations of <code>stty</code> are allowed to generate output with spaces and later expect the shell to split it and pass multiple arguments. What is specified is a constraint that the output of <code>stty -g</code> must be safe when unquoted, it must not trigger word expansion in a shell. For portability unquoted <code>$saveterm</code> is better.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To know what byte was read you need to save the output of <code>dd</code>, either to a regular file (<code>&gt;some_file</code>) that you will examine later, or to a variable (<code>variable=&quot;$(dd …)&quot;</code>). But:</p>
<ul>
<li>A terminal is able to generate a null byte (commonly with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd>) but most (all?) implementations of <code>sh</code> cannot store a null byte in a variable. Storing in a file is OK, if only you can examine/manipulate its content without reading it into a variable.</li>
<li><code>dd</code> from the above code will give you only one byte, it may not be enough to tell the character or the key. OTOH a single byte should be enough to tell apart e.g. <kbd>Q</kbd> from anything else, so <code>Press Q to quit or any other key to continue.</code> or <code>P - proceed; B - back; Q - quit; H - help</code> seem possible to implement without analyzing more bytes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<p>Since a long time, you may have made so many custom settings in Microsoft Outlook that you can’t reset to the default settings easily. These custom settings may affect your daily work or even make your Outlook collapse. Now you’d better reset your Microsoft Outlook to the factory settings (or first time run).</p>
<p>To reset Microsoft Outlook to the factory settings (or first time run), please do as following:</p>
<p>Step 1: Close your Microsoft Outlook, and open the Control Panel in your computer:</p>
<p>In Windows 7, please click the Start button at the bottom-left corner of Taskbar &gt; Control Panel.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L2jTI.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter image description here</a>

<p>(2) Then click the Mail in the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Step 3: In the popping up Mail Setup dialog box, please click the Show Profiles button.</p>
<p>Step 4: In the coming Mail dialog box, please click the Add button.</p>
<p>Step 5: In the popping up New Profile dialog box, enter a name for the new profile in the Profile Name box, and then click the OK button. See screen shot:</p>
<p>Step 6: In the popping Add (New E-mail) Account dialog box, please click the Cancel to close it; and then click the OK button in the other warning dialog box.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now you will get back to the Mail dialog box, please check the option of Always use this profile, and then click the box below it and select the new profile name from the drop down list, at last click the OK button.</p>
<p>Step 8: Exit the Control Panel.</p>
<p>After configuring the profile settings, the Microsoft Outlook will get back to the factory settings (the status you run for the first time). When you open Microsoft Outlook, it will show as following screen shot:</p>

<p>The reason is that in Windows 10, by default, support for the SMB v 1 protocol is disabled. And Windows XP uses this version of the protocol for network exchange.</p>
<p>The problem can be solved simply. You need to install the SMB v 1 component. To do this, you need to open the Windows 10 settings (via the Start menu), and there open the &quot;Applications and features&quot; settings group. In this group you need to find and open &quot;Programs and Features&quot;
In the list of programs, you need to open &quot;Turn on or off by Windows component&quot;.
In the list of components, you need to find and mark the components &quot;SMB Client and Server 1&quot;.
After installing the components, you need to check that the same Workgroup is specified in the computer names settings. And on a Windows 10 computer, disable password-protected sharing, unless of course you need to restrict access on your local network.</p>

<p>If the laptop will fold out totally flat so you could apply it with the same quality of light seal to another display, then you have at least a start-point - you'd then need to track down the profile it made on the laptop &amp; persuade the OS on the display's usual computer to use it as default.<br />
In theory, changing the GPU etc as you swap machines should not affect this calibration.

<p>However, the other way around, for <code>10.42.0.1/255.255.255.0</code> the IP of

1606574,1,2020-12-01 20:50:58.540,0,"<p>I have a long report that has developed the problem of an unusually thick border. There is nothing in the footer and I have created an example document that is an emptied version of my report document with one thing in the header. The thick footer is greatly restricting how much I can fit on each page. How can I remove this thick border and return to default. Copying and pasting the entire report into a new document brings back these chunky footers. The ruler shows the footer size to be default yet in reality its much bigger. Removing footer does nothing. Changing the position does nothing. There is no spacing. This is literally driving me insane.</p>
<p>edit: I decided to re-create the report by making a new document and copying very small sections of text only. After slowly adding the original report in bit by bit, it seemed like the thick footer appeared while adding a certain line of text just before the number of columns changed. After further investigation I found that when I used different numbers of columns on the same page, other strange things started happening. Pages that were made using page breaks were undeletable after changing page size with no text cursor on the page and delete and backspace doing nothing, page size of the first page was not respected when adding a new page, an page was created at the end of the document at some point in my investigation with the same font as the line earlier in the report that caused the thick footer and was unable to be changed or the page removed. Other stuff happened that is very hard to explain clearly without an essay. Also I should mention that the default template is completely fine. The document I have shown as an example has nothing in it at all and the text style set to normal. My guess is that the template I'm required to use is old and broken. My new report document that I made from scratch to look like the template works.</p>

<li>booted into Windows 10 MAIN and changed the &quot;display title&quot; for the future selection menu using bcdedit</li>
<li>rebooted to the setup image; created a fresh partition of ~150 GB, installed &quot;Windows 10 MUSIC&quot; to that partition</li>
<li>booted into Windows 10 MUSIC and changed the &quot;display title&quot; for the future selection menu using bcdedit</li>

1606585,2,2020-12-01 21:36:31.450,1,"<h2>Install an updated version of Rsync in macOS with Homebrew.</h2>
<p>I believe this is an issue with the default Rsync version on macOS being out of date due to GNU licensing issues.</p>
<p>The default macOS version of <code>rsync</code> exists in this path <code>/usr/bin/rsync</code> and has this version when this command is run <code>/usr/bin/rsync --version</code></p>
<pre><code>rsync  version 2.6.9  protocol version 29
</code></pre>
<p>I believe since your paths include non-Western / Chinese characters, this older 2.6.9 version of Rsync is choking on those characters.</p>
<p>You can use a more up-to-date version of Rsync on macOS if you install it via <a href=""https://brew.sh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Homebrew</a>. Just install it by opening up a terminal session and entering this command:</p>
<pre><code>/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Then run this command:</p>
<pre><code>brew install rsync
</code></pre>
<p>Once that command does what it has to do, an updated version of Homebrew should be installed here and you can check the version installed by running <code>/usr/local/bin/rsync --version</code> which should be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>rsync  version 3.2.3  protocol version 31
</code></pre>
<p>I used full paths for the version checking, but after that Homebrew install command is run you can just run <code>rsync --version</code> to check version and <code>which rsync</code> to check which version of Rsync is being preferred by the system.</p>

<p>I suspect you may have mistaken the terminology. In your workflow you probably use two or more <em>clients</em> attached to <em>the same</em> session. I'm not aware of any method to turn the status line off for a particular client. I think you need more than one session.</p>
<p><sup>(Note: whenever this answer states a command starting with <code>tmux</code>, it's a command to be run in a shell. A command not starting with <code>tmux</code> is a command to run in tmux (after <kbd>prefix</kbd><kbd>:</kbd> or from a key binding). Usually you can convert one form to the other (or vice versa) by removing (or prepending) the <code>tmux</code> word.)</sup></p>
<p>There are at least two ways to get the same window in another session:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can share one or more windows between multiple sessions. Let's suppose there already is session <code>0</code> with a window <code>0:0</code>. Instead of attaching to the session <code>0</code> with another client (<code>tmux attach</code>), create a new session (<code>tmux new-session</code> or <code>tmux new</code> in short). Let's say the new session is <code>1</code>. Then you can <code>link-window</code> the old window to the new session:</p>
<pre><code>tmux link-window -s 0:0 -t 1:
</code></pre>
<p>A complementary command is <code>unlink-window</code>. Other windows can be created, linked or unlinked in each session independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can create a new session in the same session group. Instead of attaching to the session <code>0</code> with another client (<code>tmux attach</code>), create a new session like this:</p>
<pre><code>tmux new -t 0:
</code></pre>
<p>The new session will be denoted <code>0-1</code> or similar. Sessions in the same group share the same set of windows. New windows are linked to all sessions in the group and any windows closed removed from all sessions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please compare <a href=""https://superuser.com/a/1489266/432690"">this another answer of mine</a> posted under a question from a person who inadvertently did something like this.</p>
<p>One way or another now you have <em>two</em> sessions that share at least one window. You can <code>set status off</code> or <code>set status on</code> for each session independently. Doing it from a shell from within a shared window may target the wrong session, so either explicitly specify the session you want to affect:</p>
<pre><code>tmux set -t 0-1: status off
</code></pre>
<p>or don't do this via a shell, do this directly in tmux:</p>
<pre><kbd>prefix</kbd><kbd>:</kbd>set status off<kbd>Enter</kbd></pre>
<p>Possibly you will need just two sessions: one with a status line and one without. Remember you can name them (from the start with <code>new-session -s …</code> or later with <code>rename-session</code>). This way instead of <code>0:</code>, <code>1:</code> or <code>0-1:</code> you can use more descriptive custom names, e.g. <code>w</code> (like warriors: task- and timewarrior) and <code>w-noline</code>.</p>

<p>You can easily launch tmux in the background, launching an application.  Tmux provides an API to send key strokes to the application, as well as connect the application to the terminal if you want to interact with it.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ tmux new-session -d -s Super
$ tmux send-keys -t Super: &quot;uuid&quot; &quot;Enter&quot;
$ tmux capture-pane -t Super: -S - -E - -p | cat -n
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>$ uuid</p>
<p>fe253d00-3432-11eb-9984-cb225a8f7d48</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>$ tmux kill-session -t Super:
</code></pre>
<p><code>new-session -d -s Super</code> Create a new session called <code>Super</code> in the background (-d). Note <code>-s</code> to new-session names the <em>session</em>.  I havent named an application to run, so a shell is launched.</p>
<p><code>send-keys -t Super: &quot;command&quot; &quot;Enter&quot;</code> Send the keystrokes.  Tmux understands many keywords like Enter, PgUp, Escape, etc, otherwise sending UTF and raw codes via <code>send-keys -t Super: $'command\n'</code> also works.  Note the <code>-t</code> refers to a <em>target</em> which includes <code>[session]:[window id]:[pane #]</code>.  Since I have only the default window and pane, I leave them blank and refer only to the session. If I know there were no other sessions running, I could leave out <code>-t</code> entirely.</p>
<p><code>capture-pane -t Super: -S [start] -E [end] -p</code> Copies the contents of the window.  By default, panes are captures to internal buffers you can save, or paste to other windows.  the <code>-p</code> causes the contents to be piped to the screen.  Note the captured data can be much longer than a screenfull.</p>
<p>The best part is, if you have left the application or session running, <code>tmux attach -t Super:</code> will drop you into the running session so you can interact with the application.</p>
<p>Many people use tmux to launch long running interactive programs as a background service they can attach to later, or as part of an automated test solution.</p>

<p>In general, the kernel that is installed on the system is the kernel that the system should be using. Which sounds odd to say, but that is basically it.</p>
<p>What is odd in your case is the disparity between two kernels for each Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS install. One is <code>5.3.0-1039-gke</code> and the other is <code>4.15.0-124-generic</code>. This is what I know:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>5.3.0-1039-gke</code>: As far as I know the <code>gke</code> stands for “Google Kubernetes Engine” and it would seem that kernel is specific for that usage? Odd that you have that installed on a desktop system.</li>
<li><code>4.15.0-124-generic</code>: That <code>generic</code> is what it means… That is a generic version of the Kernel for that install.</li>

<p>“That is the optimized Kernel for those those specifications: <code>-gke</code> for one and <code>-generic</code> for another.”</p>

<p>While your post implies both machines are 100% the same, my personal feeling is something is different between the two of them. Perhaps the motherboards or BIOS’s are different? That is the only rational explanation I can see for why there is such a wide disparity between kernel versions here.</p>
<p>In general though, I would not sweat it. Yes, kernel updates are important… But mainly in the context of servers that are exposed to the world. If these are just two personal machines I highly doubt you will notice a difference between the two boxes. Just enjoy them!</p>

<p>Up to the point where you replugged the drive back onto your original machine, there was nothing wrong with it, since it had been properly detected then, and, as you should be able to tell, there's simply no way Rufus could have &quot;magically&quot; rendered your drive inoperable between the time you unplugged the drive from the computer you planned to boot it on and plugged it back on the computer you created the drive with (The message you saw when you tried to boot the USB is a simple text output produced by invoking basic BIOS functions, and not some kind of fancy executable that's accessing the USB. As a matter of fact, the <a href=""https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/blob/master/res/mbr/msg.S"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">code to display that message</a> requires no knowledge of USB, and even if it was buggy and wrote garbage data all over the drive —not a small feat considering that the code is designed to simply invoke BIOS calls to <strong>read</strong> and display data— you would just end up with an unpartitioned drive that any application could repartition and reformat since this would not, in any way, make the drive undetectable).</p>
<p>So, by the looks of it, your flash drive simply <strong>failed</strong> when you plugged it back on that other computer, and <a href=""https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/FAQ#Help_Rufus_damaged_my_flash_drive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rufus had nothing whatsoever to do with that</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, if it's not detected any longer on any of your computers, then there's nothing any software can do to salvage it. Your drive is dead and you will just have to replace it.</p>
<p>What I usually recommend, as a last resort, is to see if your drive is recognized at all on a non Windows machine (e.g. Linux). But considering that your drive can't be listed in Rufus any longer, it is most likely dead.</p>

<p><code>Call to WHvSetupPartition failed: ERROR_SUCCESS (Last=0xc000000d/87) (VERR_NEM_VM_CREATE_FAILED).</code></p>
<p>This points to an issue with the widespread conflict between VirtualBox and Windows Hyper-V.

<p>Unfortunately, my existing VM still wouldn't boot and was now stuck at the point where it brings up the additional processors. I eventually got it to boot by changing the settings to use a single processor. Obviously that isn't ideal and the performance is substantially worse, so if anybody figures out a better solution please let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2 days later:</strong>
Once I had the old VM booting again I tried changing it back to using 4 processors. It successfully booted but performance still suffers. For comparison, I created a new VM with the same configuration (8GB mem, 4 CPU) and it requires about 1/6th the CPU load to run. So it appears (in my case) there is a performance drag associated with the older VMs running on the latest versions of Windows and VirtualBox, but if a new VM is created (where virtualization is disabled as noted above) then the performance issue doesn't seem to be present.</p>

<li>To list all available <code>Wmi-Objects</code> use <code>Get-WmiObject -List</code> (very difficult to locate your needed object this way).</li>

1606732,2,2020-12-02 12:20:24.817,2,"<h2>Issue analysis</h2>
<p>Your problem is that Windows goes through each entry in the PATH variable and checks if a binary of the name you're calling exists in there and aborts the search on the first match. Since your PATH variable contains the Python <code>Scripts</code> entries before the common Windows paths they'll override default commands since they contain a script called ping.</p>
<p>It's uncommon to add custom paths to the beginning of the PATH variable. You usually append to its end.</p>
<h2>How to fix:</h2>
<p>Take the list above and combine all entries with <code>;</code> as delimiter. But make sure to move the following entries to the end of the list:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts\
C:\Program Files\Python36\
C:\Program Files\Python37\Scripts\
C:\Program Files\Python37\
C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.03-hotspot\bin
C:\Program Files (x86)\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-8.0.212.03-hotspot\bin
C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jre-11.0.3.7-hotspot\bin
</code></pre>
<p>Then follow these steps to update the PATH variable:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Windows desktop, right-click <strong>My Computer</strong>.</li>
<li>In the pop-up menu, click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>System Properties</strong> window, click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Environment Variables</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>System Variables</strong> window, highlight <strong>Path</strong>, and click Edit.</li>
<li>In the Edit System Variables window, replace the list with your prepared list of entries (the full list from your post, reordered, with semicolons as delimiters).
If the last character is not a semi-colon (;), add one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally reboot the computer to ensure that all programs use the updated PATH variable.</p>
<h2>Edit</h2>
<p>It seems in Windows 10 they updated the PATH editor so that when you edit the variable you get a little editor window that allows you to edit each entry separately and also allows you to move them up and down. Simply move the Python entries to the bottom of the list.</p>

1606736,1,2020-12-02 12:45:26.747,0,"<p>I've had hard drives fail before, and they often clicked near the end. My laptop is a 2016 Lenovo Z51 with a magnetic HD, and it recently started making strange sounds while idle about once every two hours or so. It's closer to a loud chirp than the clicking I've heard with other drives, but I'm worried that it's the hard drive.</p>
<p>Things I've tried to rule out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy/extended hard drive seek noises (e.g. when swapping, swapoffing, or opening large directories/files): The odd sound is louder and isolated and seemingly happens even when idle, not just when I know there's I/O.</li>
<li>Isolated hard drive seek noises (e.g. with &lt;10 terminals open or when browsing): With light I/O, I often get similar sounds, but the recent noises are much louder.</li>
<li>Speaker mute/unmute noises: Muting/unmuting the speaker on Windows (but not Linux with ALSA or Pulseaudio) produces a loud click, but it's just a mildly irritating burst of white noise and not a chirping sound.</li>
<li>Stray audio: I don't have any system sounds in my default environment, and the chirps persist even when muted.</li>
</ul>
<p>My question is mostly one of whether I should run fsck at this point as opposed to replacing the drive (or if it's something innocuous). If it's not the hard drive, are there any particular components it's likely to be instead? Is there a relatively nondestructive way to pin down what's wrong?</p>

<p>Get a replacement drive that's at least the size of the old one. Clone the disk (see next paragraph). Then run a filesystem check. Once it's done, you can resize partitions to fill entire new drive. Re-enable disk power saving if you want to use it.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to use faster cloning methods that skip unused sectors, but doing that before filesystem check could be unsafe. On the other hand this approach will put less stress on the (potentially) failing drive and could skip problematic drive areas. If your backups are in good condition, you could go for the fast clone and then restore missing files (if any).</p>

1606749,1,2020-12-02 13:34:30.143,0,"<p>Since some time my PC gives (3 beeps, pause, 3 beeps, reboot) repeatedly on boot. Nothing on the screen.
Googling for this beep code gave me no meaningful results (it's certainly not a keyboard problem).
After many (around 30) tries of booting, it sometimes gets through and then I can use my PC for days (without powering down) without a problem. But once a few days my screens are black, keyboard lights frozen. After restarting my PC, I'm again faced with the boot issue.</p>
<p>My first though was that it is a GPU problem, as I could boot when I removed my GPU and used my motherboard video. However, that seems to have been a fluke.</p>
<p>Today removing the GPU didn't help as well and I started investigating further. I removed all devices attached to my PC. I unplugged all SATA cables (I don't have an M.2 SSD), removed my GPU, used a different PSU and removed 2 of the 3RAM sticks, changing which one of the 3 I used. I did a CMOS reset and used a new CMOS battery. I still couldn't boot, with the same beep code.</p>
<p>I plugged everything in again and started the boot loop. After about 20 minutes the PC finally booted successfuly. After confirming the UEFI default settings, and a rather long boot, Windows started without problems.</p>
<p>So... that's the current situation. I can use my PC but I'm afraid of rebooting it or powering down for any reason.</p>
<p>I guess it must be something related to the motherboard or CPU as I ruled out virtually everything else.</p>
<p>I can just buy a new motherboard and CPU (and probably RAM, because this one is still DDR3), but it would be nice to know what happened.</p>

<p>Alias is a purely textual replacement. Your alias injects so much code it would be more elegant if <code>myproject</code> was a function. This is a side &quot;issue&quot;. You can stick to the alias if you want.</p>
<p>The main issue is you're expecting <code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code> to work in the newly opened tab. When your alias replaces <code>myproject</code> with</p>
<pre><code>… gnome-terminal --tab --active &amp;&amp; cd ~/code/myproject-ember
</code></pre>
<p>and this code is executed, the fact that <code>gnome-terminal</code> is executed will not inject the next command (<code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code>) into a command line <em>there</em>. <code>cd</code> will be executed in the current shell after this particular <code>gnome-terminal</code> process exits successfully. The whole snippet is similar to:</p>
<pre><code>… true &amp;&amp; cd …
</code></pre>
<p>and there's no reason why this <code>cd</code> should be performed anywhere else than in the shell that executes the whole command.</p>
<p>Your attempt with <code>gnome-terminal --tab -e &quot;cd ~/code/myproject-ember&quot;</code> fails because:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> is never expanded. I understand the tilde is single-quoted when you define the alias. Then after the alias expansion it's <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/151850/108618"">double-quoted</a>. Then <code>gnome-terminal</code> receives the string <code>cd ~/code/myproject-ember</code>, splits it to words (without expanding the tilde) and tries to run the resulting command, but not in a shell (that could otherwise finally expand the tilde).</li>
<li>Running <code>cd</code> this way makes no sense. <code>cd …</code> is executed not in a shell; this requires a <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/38808/108618"">separate <code>cd</code> executable</a>, you may or may not have it in your OS. Even if you had it and even if the tilde was expanded, <code>gnome-terminal</code> would execute <code>cd</code> that would do its pointless job (change its own directory) and exit; and there would be nothing more to do in this tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>The right way to make <code>gnome-terminal</code> start an interactive shell in some directory is <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/a/75223/693277"">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>gnome-terminal --working-directory=/path/to/dir
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly as before, <code>gnome-terminal</code> won't expand <code>~</code> if it gets it after <code>--working-directory=</code>. Better use <code>$HOME</code> and and make sure it's expanded by your current shell. If you choose to use an alias, it may be:</p>
<pre><code>alias myproject='cd ~/code/myproject-rails &amp;&amp; rails s &amp; cd ~/code/myproject-ember &amp;&amp; ember s &amp; gnome-terminal --tab --active &quot;--working-directory=$HOME/code/myproject-ember&quot;'
</code></pre>
<p>In this case <code>$HOME</code> will be expanded after each alias expansion.</p>
<p>As I said, IMO a function would be more elegant:</p>
<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>unalias myproject
myproject () {
   cd ~/code/myproject-rails &amp;&amp; rails s &amp;
   cd ~/code/myproject-ember &amp;&amp; ember s &amp;
   gnome-terminal --tab --active &quot;--working-directory=$HOME/code/myproject-ember&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note <code>rails</code> and <code>ember</code> will become jobs in the <em>old</em> shell. I don't know what they are but <em>maybe</em> you'd like to have them as jobs in the new shell. It can be done but I won't elaborate here. (If you need it and don't find a solution, ask a separate question.)</p>

<p>This likely depends on the settings available on your gateway hardware.</p>

<p>How can I do that?</p>

<p>If the unit includes router functionality and supports port forwarding, it may be possible to simply forward the range of ports you wish to monitor to the specific internal IP/port combination you wish to have listen for these requests.</p>

<p>My aim is to log all the requests sent to my IP for these ports.</p>

The web and email servers work on the CentOS box as long as (a) ports 80 and 25 are forwarded from the VS machine, and (b) CentOS is connected to VS machine with VPN. The conundrum is that both web servers (on VS and CentOS) are accessible from public Internet when port 80 is forwarded from VS, but email receiving works only on CentOS. Postfix on the VS rejects incoming mail with <code>Relay access denied</code>. If I remove forwarding port 25 Postfix on VS does receive mail, but CentOS will not. Same situation if I change master.cf on VS from smtp to smtps (not using the forwarded port 25). How can I set up the VS Postfix so it accepts incoming mail while port 25 is forwarded - just as Apache can serve web pages from both machines while port 80 is fowarded from the VS machine?

<p>I strongly believe this is a physical issue with the mouse and specifically with the wheel being gunked up in some way based on my own personal experience.</p>
<p>This is not a statement on cleanliness and such but rather — and if you think about it — most uses of the scroll wheel are up, humans shed skin regularly. So the more you scroll up — and exist as a functional human being the more stuff will get into the insides of the mouse and gunk things go.</p>
<p>FWIW, petty much every mouse I have owned — all of them Kensington mice — had this issue. I solved the issue each time by opening up the mice, cleaning up the insides — which were indeed dunked up— and reassembling them. FWIW, I use a MacBook with a trackpad now so don’t use them anymore.</p>

1606840,2,2020-12-02 19:56:47.893,1,"<p>Well, it's hard to see the point of what you're doing with just this formula to look at.</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> it is taken as essentially your plan, with the exception of the error Excel reports, then you have the following concept in your formula:</p>
<p><em>IF some condition (N16=1 in this case) is TRUE, then report THIS (whatever &quot;THIS&quot; is) and if it is not TRUE, report THIS (whatever &quot;THIS&quot; is) ANYWAY.</em></p>
<p>That boils down to being the same as the following:</p>
<pre><code>=IF(A1=1,50,50)
</code></pre>
<p>The point being that if you get the same results for TRUE and for FALSE, then there's no point in the <code>IF()</code>. Note that there can be reasons external to the logic in the situation and, who knows, one of them may apply. Since you give no information meaningful to resolving THAT, one cannot say. But if none do, and that seems very likely, why use the <code>IF()</code> at all?</p>
<p>So only the result of either TRUE or FALSE matters here (since they are the same). You can simplify your formula by just using one of those portions of the formula.</p>
<p>That's if you want to &quot;simplify&quot; it. If you'd rather <strong>GREATLY simplify</strong> it, then consider what each test does. Your basic result in each test is to subtract 2 from some cell, then multiply it by the test cell. Cool. If that test cell is blank, Excel will consider it to be 0 and that multiplication will give you 0. So why bother testing whether it is blank if the reason to do so is to make the result 0? <em>Just the actual multiplication will do that for you without anything else needed.</em> If you drop the extra work, and the whole <code>IF()</code> idea, you get the following:</p>
<pre><code>=(2  *  C8*(D8-2)  -  C9*(D9-2)  -  C11*(D11-2)  +  C12*(D12-2)  )  /2
</code></pre>
<p>and since there seems to be no reason to multiply that by 2, then divide it by 2, take that out as well:</p>
<pre><code>=C8*(D8-2)  -  C9*(D9-2)  -  C11*(D11-2)  +  C12*(D12-2)
</code></pre>
<p>I'll take it that the expected &quot;C10*(D10-2)&quot; is not there for good reasons and go onward.</p>
<p>Stopping the simplifying at this point (since anyway, technically speaking, anything more happens to be &quot;streamlining&quot; more than &quot;simplifying&quot; in this case), I'd point out one huge advantage to using the above and not your formula:</p>
<p>It's so simple, and easy to type or generate, that silly entry errors should be hard to have happen, and should be extraordinarily easy to figure out if they do. Contrast that will your formula and the advantage should be easy to see.</p>
<p>That, and not the particular tricks of the trade above is the important part of this answer.</p>

This ended up being a little harder than expected, not least because it took me a while to realise that <code>file</code> isn't reliable at determining whether a file is ASCII or UTF-8 (because it doesn't check the whole of the file), so I'm putting this answer up here for posterity.</p>
<p>To definitively determine what encoding your files are in, first make sure the <code>uchardet</code> package is installed via the Cygwin Installer or <a href=""https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apt-cyg</a>, then run:</p>
<pre><code>uchardet *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you're not on Cygwin:</p>
<pre><code>chardet *.txt 
</code></pre>
<p>Move all of the files that <code>chardet</code> lists as <code>ASCII</code> to a folder of their own, and run the following <code>for</code> loop in that folder:</p>
<pre><code>for i in *.txt; do iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-8 &quot;$i&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;${i%.txt}_utf.txt&quot;; done;
</code></pre>
<p>It will loop through all <code>.txt</code> files in a folder and create UTF-8 versions of them with the <code>utf</code> suffix added.</p>
<p>Running <code>uchardet *.txt</code> again may still show some files as being <code>ASCII</code>. This happens because ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/36030982/1191147"">simply means</a> that those files don't contain characters outside the ASCII range of 128 bits.</p>
<p>You should now be able to run <code>sort</code> without needing to use <code>LC_ALL=C</code>.</p>

<li>For any console or RDC logged in user to have normal (not VPN) access to the internet.</li>
<li>On system startup the headless and auto-start of all components.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can manually set the OpenVPN Tap adapter to share with Wireless Network 3 (MS Virtual Wifi Miniport) but the share is not persistent - after reboot another manual share setting is required. There is no W7 patch to fix this.</p>
<p>The wireless hosted network was created with:</p>
<pre><code>netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow &quot;ssid=MySSID&quot; &quot;key=MyKey&quot; keyUsage=persistent 
netsh wlan start hostednetwork

<p>As HelpingHand posted, you can use <code>set PROMPT=%COMPUTERNAME%-$P$G</code> in the command prompt terminal to set it temporarily.</p>
<p>To make it permanent, you need to create a new <code>string value</code> registry key in <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor</code> named <code>autorun</code> and set the value of that key as <code>PROMPT=%COMPUTERNAME%-$P$G</code>.</p>

<p>Powershell is similar to Linux shells, in which you create a <code>profile.ps1</code> file that contains the commands you want to run.

<p>And MKVtoolNix apparently does no transcoding or reencoding so it's inherently very fast and lossless. Output files seem small and optimized. Subtitles and many intricacies of this process are handled by default or with ease. I would keep around ffmpeg for doing a quick cleanup of seek indexing via a &quot;-c copy&quot; command option though.</p>

1606915,1,2020-12-03 02:42:12.627,0,"<p>My department used to be a small department. As is common with small groups, system security wasn't really enforced. In short, everyone used the same login account and had root access.
As the department has grown (about 50 people and still growing) and we've moved on to more of a production role, we've had to adjust our habits.</p>
<p>We recently implemented network logins. With this came noone has root access (or sudo).
The amount of pushback I have received from this is tremendous (as is expected) as not everyone can just <code>sudo fix problem</code>. However, sudo is dangerous, and most users are electrical engineers who aren't unix savvy. After explaining why we will not be getting sudo back, their is still tremendous pushback.</p>
<p>This is where I turn to stack exchange. As I have looked on google for why not everyone should have root access. And surprisingly, this information is hard to come by. I have tried making a list myself, but it would be good to have another online source backing up what I'm saying, which I thought there would be a plethora of articles for!</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons they want sudo access back, and how I addressed their concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can't edit other user's files in a shared directory
<ul>
<li>Don't use shared directories to edit your code. Everyone should be editing in their own home directories and pushing to git. Let git do it's job and merge stuff.</li>
<li>If for whatever reason you <em>need</em> to use shared directories, have the directory owner give the group write permissions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While using a shared directory, if one person compiles, the others can no longer compile as they'd have to remove the first binary
<ul>
<li>Same response as (1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If one person pushes to git with no group write permission, the others cannot push to git
<ul>
<li>For now, set your umask (i told them how to do this). Soon, IT will be taking over all git remote ownership and will be setting up shared permissions properly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other reasons I have come up with for why sudo access would not be good.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can't accidentally delete customer data forever (this has happened)</li>
<li>We can't <code>sudo reboot</code> and kick everyone off whos remotely logged in (someone kicked me off a few times and I lost my work)</li>

If no user has root level access to the machine, then any virus or malicious programs that user may get will be limited in the damage they can do.

If a user has root level access then that virus can just run amok. Granted I daily drive Windows, and before that MacOS, so I do not have as much experience with Linux. That being said, if the user can't mess with any critical files, then the malicious program cant either. I did find an article that is looking at it from a security perspective.

<h3>PS/2 vs. USB</h3>
<p>Make sure you created the &quot;CrashOnCtrlScroll&quot; value in the correct Registry key location.  There are different key locations for PS/2 vs. USB vs. Hyper-V keyboards.  Please see <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/forcing-a-system-crash-from-the-keyboard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not sure which location to use: It's okay to create the same value in all three locations.</p>
<h3>Reboot first</h3>
<p>You must reboot your machine in order to make the Registry setting take effect.</p>
<h3>Use the rightmost Ctrl key</h3>
<p>Before pressing Scroll lock twice, you must hold down the <strong>rightmost</strong> Ctrl key.</p>
<p>Do not use the other Ctrl key; it won't work.</p>
<h3>Possible workarounds</h3>
<p>If you've tried all three of the above tips, and you still can't trigger a crash, perhaps you could instead:</p>

I find when I change the Motherboard, this problem is not happen.</p>
<p>But when I bring this to official MSI support center in my city. They say nothing wrong with their Motherboard and don't find any faulty there.
Can you guys help me what should I do? Or maybe something that i need to do to check my motherboard. Because I'm not an electrician expert, i can't check the mobo myself. Just trial and error.</p>

          &quot;a_dict length: {{ a_dict | length }}&quot;
        ]

<p>And the result:</p>
<pre><code>PLAY [localhost] ******************************************************************************************************************************

TASK [debug] **********************************************************************************************************************************

    &quot;msg&quot;: [

<p>So, how can we confirm that this is, in fact, a list before we want to check the number of elements?</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>{% if my_value is string %}
  1
{% elif my_value is iterable %}
  {{ my_value | length }}
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
<p>We have to check if it's a string <em>first</em> as strings are also iterable, whereas dictionaries (mapping) and lists (sequences) are not strings. Integers and Floats don't have a &quot;length&quot; property, so perhaps you should check for that first too (using <code>if my_value is number</code>)?</p>

1606985,2,2020-12-03 09:31:33.680,0,"<p>Very rough answer:</p>
<p>Your BIOS has tables which are evaluated by Linux during boot. Very often, those tables don't follow the ACPI standard, which nobody notices on Windows because the Vendor who wrote the tables also supply their own Windows driver which work with those tables.</p>
<p>However, there's no driver for Linux, so Linux has to somehow interpret even buggy tables.</p>
<p>The ACPI BIOS you are seeing may or may not be harmful, and may have been already present before the update. It also may be the cause of the hang.</p>
<p>The other error is more serios, the nvme device (SSD) failed during boot, which is probably the reason why the boot stops.</p>
<p>Ways to access the system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to boot a Linux distribution from an external device (e.g. USB stick), e.g. the <a href=""https://www.system-rescue.org/Installing-SystemRescue-on-a-USB-memory-stick/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">system-rescue</a> distro.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take out the SSD (if you can), put it in some device (if you have) to read and write it from another PC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get this to work, the first thing I'd do is to re-install your old kernel, and see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>I don't use Zorin OS, so I don't know how they handle things, but it's good practice to always keep the old kernel around when upgrading to a new kernel.</p>

<p>How to remove the Meet Now icon on Windows 10
Meet Now is useful to a subset of users. If you don't plan to use it, you may want to remove it from the taskbar as it takes up space without providing anything of use to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple options are available to remove Meet Now from the system. One of the easier options involves right-clicking on the Meet Now icon and selecting &quot;hide&quot; from the context menu that opens. Doing so removes the Meet Now icon from the Windows 10 taskbar.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another option that you have is to open the Settings application on the system, e.g. by using the shortcut Windows-I, or by selecting Start &gt; Settings, going to Personalization &gt; Taskbar, selecting &quot;turn system icons on or off&quot;, and toggling &quot;Meet Now&quot; on the page that opens to off. You may restore Meet Now at anytime using the Settings app, but need to make sure the feature is set to on this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Removing Meet Now via the Group Policy
System administrators may disable (or enable) the Meet Now icon on the Windows 10 taskbar using the Group Policy. The Group Policy is only available in professional editions of Windows 10, and not in Windows 10 Home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is how that is done:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You need elevated rights to use the Group Policy.
Use Windows-R to open the runbox.
Type gpedit.msc and select OK.
Go to User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar
Double-click on &quot;Remove the Meet Now icon&quot;.
Set the feature to &quot;Enabled&quot; to hide the icon on the taskbar of the Windows 10 operating system.
Restart the PC.
Removing Meet Now using the Registry
You may also remove Meet Now on Windows 10 using the Registry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Use Windows-R to open the runbox.
Type regedit.exe and select OK.
For individual users, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
Right-click on Explorer and select New &gt; Dword (32-bit) Value.
Name it HideSCAMeetNow.
Set its value to 1.
For all users, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer

<p>There is a <strong>&quot;pre-launch script&quot;</strong> option, which,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;can be used to start the slave machine, before Jenkins tries to ssh it. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plugin also offers a <strong>&quot;On-demand slave setup&quot;</strong>:
This plugin also provides you a per-slave &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; script configuration specific for on-demand slaves. This probably exactly fits your needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once installed, you will have an additional &quot;Launch method&quot; (1) for
this case:</p>
<p>this one lets you specify the &quot;Start&quot; (2) and &quot;Stop&quot; (3) scripts, and
on top of that you will be able to specify the &quot;conventional&quot;
connection (4) method for reaching the slave after it has been
started.</p>
<p>You will likely also want to specify that you want this node to be
online only when Jenkins needs it (5).</p>
<p>The figure below shows the configuration that you may want to use if
your on-demand slave is an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Select <code>C2:C4</code>:</p>

<li><p>Use conditional formatting formula:</p>
<pre><code>=DATEDIF($A2,$B2,&quot;d&quot;)&gt;365

<p>If you need this to be equal or higher then 365, then just change to <code>&gt;=</code>.</p>

<p>A much better alternative (IMHO) is to keep your original formula in <code>C2:C4</code> without the &quot;days&quot; part (<code>=DATEDIF($A2,$B2,&quot;d&quot;</code>), but change the formatting of these cells to a custom format:</p>
<pre><code>0 &quot;days&quot;

<p>Now you can simply add a conditional formatting of values higher then 365, <strong>AND</strong> you can do calculations with your cells since they simply still numbers looking like text instead of actual text.</p>

<p>First of all, I hope you are using right command as <code>antlr4</code> and not just <code>antlr</code></p>
<p><strong>Steps to set it up (on windows).</strong></p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Download the jar file from here <a href=""https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9-complete.jar</a> and save it anywhere in your <strong>C:/</strong> drive, let's say under a folder named <code>antlr</code>, i.e., C:/antlr/ (my case I simply named the folder antlr, refer image below)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWQz1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWQz1.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>STEP2:</strong> Create a <code>.bat</code> file named <code>antlr4.bat</code> and put the following content in it.</p>
<pre><code>java org.antlr.v4.Tool %*
</code></pre>
<p>(refer point 2 in above image I have kept the antlr.bat in the same folder as my jar, refer the image below to see the content of the bat file)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2n5t.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2n5t.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Similarly create one more <code>.bat</code> file named <code>grun.bat</code> and put in the same folder as the jar with the content.</p>
<pre><code>java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig %*
</code></pre>
<p>(refer the images)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now add the CLASSPATH variable in system variable, with value as the complete path to the jar file downloaded in step 1 above.
For my case it would be <code>C:\antlr\antlr-4.7.2-complete.jar</code> as I have put the downloaded jar file in C:/antlr.
Refer the image how my Classpath looks like

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> I also added the path where I have put the .bat files added in STEP2 and 3 in the PATH system variable.
(refer image, how I added the path which is C:/antlr in my case where I have those bat files present)</p>

<p>Now , when I do antlr4 on command line it works (see image)</p>

1607050,1,2020-12-03 14:10:44.873,13,"<p>As in previous versions of Windows, a user can change the screen resolution or the monitor setup in Windows 10 using the control panel. However, the dialog that asks for confirmation (&quot;Do you really want to change the screen resolution?&quot;) has a button with a timeout of approximately 15 seconds. If you do not press this button within the desired period of time, the changes will be reverted, probably in order to prevent the user from switching any resolution that their monitor setup does not support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this button is only accessible by mouse, or at least I fail to find a Shortcut (like Alt-y for &quot;yes&quot;), so the very simple question is:</p>
<p>How can this button be accessed using only a keyboard?</p>
<p>I have attached a screenshot to indicate what the dialog looks like, it's in German language because this is the only test system available at the moment.</p>

<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>You have display scaling enabled, so that things on your screen aren't tiny despite pixels being much smaller physically. Display scaling needs special support in programs to work correctly.</p>
<p>Programs that are scaling-aware will take advantage of scaling. Others draw their window in a buffer as if scaling was disabled and Windows upscales them afterwards. The result is similar to zooming in on a photo, they become blurry.</p>
<p>You can disable scaling on per-application basis in properties of the EXE or a shortcut, on the <em>Compatibility</em> tab. You can also disable it altogether for entire system in <em>Display settings</em>. This will increase available screen area at the cost of everything getting smaller.</p>

1607129,2,2020-12-03 19:15:19.483,0,"<p>I've edited the title of your question, because standard delete refers to deleting a file which is less worse than a format. However, deleting a partition is worse than a format.</p>
<p>The difference is:</p>
<p>You have an allocated space called partition, and you can format that in different layouts. Format clears the partition, but delete partition removes the partition alltogether, turning it into unallocated space. If you delete multiple partitions, the new unallocated space will not be segmented. If you want to restore the partition, you have to recreate it. If you want it to be the same size as it was, then it helps to know what it was.</p>
<p>Recovering a formatted drive is easier than recovering a deleted partition. Most software can recover a formatted drive if you don't do anything with it since the format, but a deleted partition may require special tools and skills.</p>
<p>Deleting just one partition, and recreating it is not that hard though.</p>
<p>That said, you are in the Windows Setup screen, and if you go for either format or delete, it seems you do not have any sensitive data on the disk anyway. If you are considering repartitioning the entire drive to make windows use all of the space, the easiest trick is to delete all partitions, and then select the unallocated empty space and just install to that. Windows setup will then create 4 partitions. 1 big partition for your C and 3 for recovery purposes. That is the best practice, but it means you have to have backups before doing this, as the drives will be empty afterwards.</p>

Fundamentally, a partition is just an entry in a table with start and end points (and some other stuff).</p>

After a storm knocked out power and internet, they rediscovered the issue and fixed it, resulting in the problem being solved.</p>

<p>I have 3 monitors (well, 2 + TV) and need to switch between them often enough that the default Windows GUI way (which involves about 10 clicks, some scrolling and some waiting) is getting on my nerves. This is on a home PC runnign Windows 10 Pro if relevant.</p>
<p>There are two setups that I need to toggle between, see image:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4oIyf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Display setups</a></p>
<p>Case one: <strong>display 1</strong>: main, 2560x1440 <strong>display 2</strong>: disconnected <strong>display 3</strong>: 1920x1080, rotated by 90°, extending desktop</p>
<p>Case two: <strong>display 1</strong>: main, 1920x1080 <strong>display 2</strong>: duplicating 1 <strong>display 3</strong>: disconnected</p>
<p>I want to have a short script that would on execution simply toggle between the two configutation, so that I would reduce all that configuration to a single doubleclick from desktop. I expected there would be something that would allow me to select a display by its Windows-assigned ID and set its properties the way I have summed up above. Surely if you can do it via clicking in the GUI, there must be a way to do it via command line? But I found none.</p>
<p>There is the MS displayswitch.exe tool which is way too basic for this case.</p>
<p>An often recommended tool is the MultiMonitor Tool from Nirsoft. In my experience it fails at this because it seems unable to set display as duplicate, and also it seems to get confused which display is which. I tried saving both configurations while they were active and then loading them, and it botches the job, ending up with something completely different.</p>

1607183,2,2020-12-03 23:56:03.380,1,"<p>I realise this post is several months old, but I've also invested in a dual WAN setup at home since I've nearly been working at home a year now and my local cable provider has very regular outages/slowness etc, but when it works, it's amazingly fast. But when you have no internet, you can't work and as a contractor that means I don't get paid.</p>
<p>So I found a 4G router being sold with an unlimited data SIM by a network in the UK called three and it was pretty cheap. I already have cable internet. So I built a pfSense firewall (free software) and bought a 4 port gigabit network card for very cheap.</p>
<p>I've now got my home setup such that if my main internet connection dies, or has packet loss, it will swap over to the 4G connection (in around about 1-2 seconds) and all the devices in the house use that without reconfiguring anything you just have to wait a couple of seconds and normal service is resumed.</p>
<p>I don't have to do anything special in terms of DHCP, one DHCP server (the pfSense box) hands out all my IP addresses then pfSense figures out which gateway to send the traffic to.</p>
<p>Now I can suffer the loss of either WAN link and still be online. I used an old computer from 5 years ago as the router, and I paid around about £50 (about $70 USD) for the 4 port gigabit card. My WiFi also routes to pfSense so all wireless devices continue to work. It's very much set and forget too, I like to poke around at it but equally i've left it for months at a time without having to do anything (and i've never ever had to reset it).</p>
<p>There are of course hardware routers that can do failover/multi-wan. I've used the edgerouter-x ($60 gigabit router with 5 ports) and it has pretty good failover too, you could do the same here with one ISP in one ethernet port and another ISP / 4G in the other.</p>

1607184,1,2020-12-04 00:04:30.217,0,"<p>So, I discovered a strange quirk of the Windows 10 ping utility. If you ping a whole number instead of an IP address, it will &quot;convert&quot; that number to an IPv4 address. The conversion is such that the first octet is your 256^3 spot, second octet is 256^2, third is 256^1, and the last octet being the &quot;ones&quot; place or 256^0.</p>
<p>For example &quot;ping 200&quot; will ping 0.0.0.200, but &quot;ping 400&quot; will ping 0.0.1.144, where the &quot;1&quot; in the third octet represents 256 (256 + 144 = 400).</p>
<p>A quick Google search (although I couldn't think of a great search term) didn't bring anything.</p>
<p>My only two theories are this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It may be the case that in an earlier iteration of the IP schema (i.e. the unused v1, v2, or v3), the plan was to just use single whole numbers. Microsoft, in its' obsession with backwards compatibility wrote a translation algorithm into the ping utility to handle this way way back when ping was first coded.</li>
<li>It may be the case that due to the way the ping utility is coded, it normally takes a valid IPv4 address and translates it to a single whole number before doing something with that data. Thus, as a check in the code, if it sees that the user entered a single whole number, it just skips that initial translation step.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any ideas? It definitely intrigued my co-workers, but they were just as clueless as I am.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just tested it on my Arch Linux machine, and I can confirm that the behavior exists there as well, so that likely discredits my first theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other address representations were in common use when classful networking was practiced. For example, the loopback address 127.0.0.1 is commonly written as 127.1, given that it belongs to a class-A network with eight bits for the network mask and 24 bits for the host number. When fewer than four numbers are specified in the address in dotted notation, the last value is treated as an integer of as many bytes as are required to fill out the address to four octets. Thus, the address 127.65530 is equivalent to 127.0.255.250.</p>

<p>You often use the &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; command to do a loop test on the machine to verify whether the TCP/IP protocol suite of the machine is correctly installed. But did you find it? The same test result can be obtained by using the command &quot;ping 127.1&quot;. In fact, the two commands &quot;ping 127.1&quot; and &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; are the same, both of which are performing loop tests.</p>
<p>Why is this so? This is the skill of using IP address in Ping command application. Everyone knows that the IP address is composed of 32 binary digits. In order to make it easier for everyone to remember, every 8 binary digits are converted into decimal digits. Therefore, an easy-to-remember IP address consisting of four-part decimal digits (such as 127.0.0.1 ). Since the Windows operating system has the function of automatically filling &quot;.0&quot;, I can change &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; to &quot;127.1&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the omission of this &quot;.0&quot; is conditionally restricted and cannot be omitted arbitrarily. In the application of the Ping command, you can only omit one or more &quot;.0&quot;s that appear before the last decimal number of the IP address, such as rewriting the &quot;ping 127.0.0.1&quot; command to &quot;ping 127.1&quot;.</p>
<p>If the one or more &quot;.0&quot; is not next to the last part of the decimal number, but in other positions, then this &quot;.0&quot; cannot be omitted, such as &quot;ping 202.0.96.1&quot; cannot be written as &quot;ping 202.96.1&quot; &quot;. This is because the result returned by &quot;ping 202.96.1&quot; is the response message of &quot;202.96.0.1&quot; instead of the response message of &quot;202.0.96.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Number string instead of IP address</strong></p>
<p>In the Ping command, you can also use a numeric string instead of an IP address. Run the &quot;ping 3658906394&quot; command, and you will see the return information of the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot;.</p>
<p>Why is this so? In fact, &quot;3658906394&quot; is another representation of the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot;. Of course, you can also ping other IP addresses in the same way.</p>
<p>How is the string converted? In fact, it is not complicated. Taking the IP address &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; as an example, the method of converting the IP address into a numeric string is as follows: first convert &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; to hexadecimal &quot;DA.16.7B.1A&quot;, and then remove it. After the decimal point, it becomes &quot;DA167B1A&quot;, and finally the hexadecimal number is converted to decimal &quot;3658906394&quot;, then &quot;218.22.123.26&quot; becomes &quot;3658906394&quot;. The same method is used to convert other IP addresses into numeric strings.</p>
<p>Tip: In some LAN environments, using the &quot;Ping+number string&quot; command may fail, and the prompt message &quot;Unknown host number string&quot; appears. This is because the number string is resolved into a host name instead of an IP address.</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>I'm trying to create a prototype that will allow clients to communicate with a local web server on a different network. The webserver is hosted on the same network as the VPN server.
So far, I'm able to route the client packet (ex: SYN) to a virtual interface (tun) and send the entire packet to the VPN Server. On the Server side, I receive these packets, change the source and destination IPs, and recalculate the checksums inside the headers.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the flow is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>User tries to access web server with a certain ip address.</li>
<li>The SYN packet is sent to the virtual interface because it matches routes in the routing table.</li>
<li>The VPN Client application sends the SYN packet to the VPN Server through an established websocket connection (shouldn't matter what kind of connection this is)</li>
<li>The VPN Server receives the packet and modifies the source / destination ip address to point to the actual web server hosted on the same network.</li>
<li>How do I send these packets to the webserver and receive responses from the webserver? I want the client to communicate with the webserver through the VPN server / established web socket connection. What are some options I have?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>How can I send these packets to the web server, and receives packets back from the webserver to send back to the client? Do I &quot;inject&quot; packets into the correct interface and make sure my application sends the responses back to the client? I want the client to communicate with the webserver through the VPN server / established web socket connection. What are some options I have and in general, how do current VPN Server's do this?</p>
<h3>What I have tried</h3>
<p>What I've tried to do on the server side is I've created a virtual interface (tun) and wrote the packets received from the client into the interface. However, these packets do not get sent out to the webserver. The client and server are running on macOS using Network Extensions if that is of any use. The web server is running on <code>192.168.1.95</code>, and I've modified the packet's source IP to <code>100.64.0.77</code> before writing to the <code>tun</code> interface.</p>

<p>The VPN Server receives the packet and modifies the source / destination ip address to point to the actual web server hosted on the same network.</p>

<p>This shouldn't ever be needed, because the client has already specified the destination IP address they want.

<p>NAT can be done (and is occassionally done), but it's more often the OS firewall's job and the sysadmin's decision – it shouldn't be done by the VPN software all on its own.

<p>Typically, the VPN server will have a virtual interface exactly like the VPN client and will use exactly the same mechanisms to produce and receive packets.

<li><p>The solution you mentioned yourself is in my opinion the best option, you can create a row total above the table heading and refer it to the table's total row. Then you can freeze the top rows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another solution is to use the split screen function. To do this select the total row, navigate to the View menu and click on split. This will split your worksheet in two windows. You can then arrange the window to your preference.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also create a new window by navigating to the view menu and clicking on New window. Then arrange All and select e.g. horizontal. This will open a new Excel window with the same content and arrange the windows.

<ul>
<li><p>Intel and AMD CPUs in desktop and laptop computers, if properly installed, cooled, not overclocked, and not subject to electrical problems like a bad power supply, will last a very long time even if all cores are constantly 100% utilized--such that you don't usually have to worry about &quot;wearing out&quot; your CPU.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore, even from the first PC's of the early 80's, disk drives used something called Direct Memory Access (DMA).  Floppy drives have used DMA since the first PC, and hard drives started to have DMA modes probably sometime in the late 80's.</p>
<p>DMA basically allows drives to transfer data to and from RAM without the CPU in the middle.  So hard drive transfers have even less of a CPU impact than you might think.</p>
<p>Where the CPU might still be in the middle is if you have disk encryption running on your system, such as Bitlocker, TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt, or other.  But it's still not going to be anything to worry about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are causing an HDD hard drive (not an SSD) to work harder by copying from it constantly.  You are adding wear to an SDD by copying <em>to</em> it.  Spinning-rust HDDs and even SSDs do have a finite lifetime that is likely less than your CPU.</p>

1607375,2,2020-12-04 17:40:31.940,4,"<p><strong>Damage to CPU - Minimal, if any</strong></p>
<p>1a. CPUs are not heavily involved in file copies - The CPU's job is to tell the other hardware to do the transfer, and the actual transfer of 1's and 0's is left to other chipsets/IO's to do.</p>
<p>1b. Even if a file transfer did use a lot of CPU, CPUs have incredibly good longevity and usually processors don't fail or go bad - they <em>do</em> get replaced regularly due to being outdated - which speaks to the fact of its longevity - a CPU will outlive its efficiency lifespan.</p>
<p><strong>Damage to HDD - Still minimal, but worth considering</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using an HDD wears an HDD. It has moving parts, so the more they're used, the more potential for damage from wear - but if you can't use it it's useless anyway. The best practice for HDDs is to know that at some point, it <strong>will</strong> fail and to have backups - this is the only real protection you have against HDD failure - backups.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You <em>can</em> reduce the wear and tear on the HDD by ensuring that you run a single copy command at any given time (which is what I suspect is the typical method), so whether you do a drag &amp; drop or a command line like <code>robocopy</code>, make sure you only do one of this actions and let it complete before starting another one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Your specific questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>No, you will not affect your CPU in a negative way, in fact you can open task manager during this and probably witness your CPU not go over 20% usage, depending on what else your computer is doing in the background.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No, all CPUs are built to be robust - a 3rd gen i7 vs an 8th gen i9, or a Ryzen7, what have you, is engineered to last and endure utilization far above what a file transfer will do to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No, this would not be a helpful method to reduce the damage that we've already stated is negligible. Even if your CPU isn't properly cooled, this low utilization should not make it overheat - and if it does, its performance will only be affected while it's too hot - its lifetime performance/longevity will not be affected by overheating.</p>

# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one

# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual

1607419,2,2020-12-04 20:40:56.857,0,"<p>This is an apparent bug with the gcc-10 packages in Debian: they renamed a package and removed the transitional packages before the release of Bullseye. The following packages were renamed (to match stated convention/debian policy more closely, I think):</p>
<ul>
<li>libgcc1 -&gt; libgcc-s1</li>
<li>lib64gcc1 -&gt; lib64gcc-s1 (on 32 bit architectures only)</li>
<li>lib32gcc1 -&gt; lib32gcc-s1 (on 64 bit architectures only)</li>
<li>libx32gcc1 -&gt; libx32gcc-s1 (on x86_64 only)</li>
<li>a few others on less common arches</li>
</ul>
<p>The newly-renamed packages have a <code>Provides: libgcc1</code> (etc.) property, but it
appears that apt is preferring a real (old) libgcc1 package over a virtual
package that is only &quot;provide&quot;d by the newer package, since it's trying to not
break your system. I am not familiar with the details of the internals of
dependency resolution and installation order, but that's how I understand the
problem anyway.</p>
<p>The way to really solve the problem, at least until a fix in the distro, is to provide &quot;real&quot; (but empty &quot;transitional&quot;) packages named using the old name, that depend on the package's new name. I have done this over at <a href=""https://salsa.debian.org/rpavlik/gcc-10-compat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://salsa.debian.org/rpavlik/gcc-10-compat</a> (including a repo to add with the packages). There's more details about the problem, and instructions to use my workaround, over there.</p>
<p>Since I know link-only answers are frowned upon, here's approximately what my workaround effectively does:</p>
<p>You can use the <code>equivs</code> package to make your own empty packages. (You may need to do this on a different system or undo your repo changes, to be able to install equivs!) Once <code>equivs</code> is installed, you'll want to do something like this for each of the package renames:</p>
<pre><code># create equivs control file named libgcc1
equivs-control libgcc1.control

# edit equivs control file: you will need to set:
# - &quot;Package&quot; name to the old name
# - &quot;Version&quot; to something larger than the old version: 10.1.0-1 works
# - &quot;Depends&quot; to the new name
nano libgcc1.control

# Build a package - add `--arch i386` to make a 32-bit build
equivs-build libgcc1.control
</code></pre>
<p>You will then need to put this into an apt repo: <strong>do not</strong> just install it directly because these will replace the essential, real libgcc, which will keep you from running apt! Making a repo is beyond the scope here, check another question or just use the repo I already made.</p>
<p>Once these new &quot;transitional&quot; libgcc1 etc. are available in an apt repo and you update your sources to choose bullseye, apt will be able to dist-upgrade/full-upgrade correctly, and you can remove the transitional packages after the upgrade is done.</p>

<li><p><strong>Show media using PowerPoint</strong> if possible. When showing images and video, I almost always do so as part of a PowerPoint presentation. Using PowerPoint animations, I can control exactly what the audience sees in Slideshow mode without my audience ever having to see the player itself nor my mouse clicking on player controls, for example. I insert each image or video using the Link-to-File insertion option (keeping media from getting stored within the PowerPoint file itself and making the file size huge). For a video, I go to the Playback ribbon and set the Start option to Automatically and usually check the Play Full Screen box. (If I have other content showing on the screen, such as an overlay title in a text box, then I just manually size the video to fit the slide and don't check the Play Full Screen box, as Full Screen mode will bring the video to the front and hide all other content.) When I advance to the slide, the video automatically starts playing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use a second monitor</strong>. If you can attach a second monitor to your computer and extend your desktop to it, avoiding gray boxes gets much easier. I have Zoom and everything else playing in my main screen, so that's where notifications and such will pop up. I play the PowerPoint slideshow on the second monitor in full-screen mode, and typically start the slideshow before the call. When it's time to share, I select the PowerPoint slideshow as what I'll be sharing, and optimize video and share system sound. With any other apps appearing only on the first monitor, no gray boxes ever appear over the slideshow content on the second monitor.</p>

<p>I have a machine that is treated as an appliance, it has multiple graphical applications open, and these must not be closed at any time.</p>
<p>HumanA might turn on the system, launch the applications, then lock the screen.</p>
<p>There is a shift change, and HumanB now takes the responsibility of the machine.</p>
<p>HumanB now needs to log into the system, and see the same graphical applications that HumanA launched.</p>
<p><strong>How I do it today</strong></p>
<p>Today we achieve this by having one user account (UserX) and both HumanA and HumanB know the password to UserX.</p>
<p>The problem is with the auditing of this system.  If we determine something very bad happened over the weekend, the log file would only tell us that UserX logged in.  This fails to meet our regulations.</p>

<p>This is a computer/monitor/keyboard setup, no remote or ssh sessions to worry about.</p>

<p>Any trick that involves &quot;moving&quot; the application can't cause any interruption in high performance computing tasks, even a 1 millisecond interruption is not acceptable.</p>

<p>At the end of a shift, HumanA &quot;logs out&quot; by restarting the screengrab application (over the long-running graphical applications), so when HumanB arrives, she must &quot;log in&quot; through the screengrab, and the user change can be recorded.</p>

1607477,2,2020-12-05 02:57:23.940,0,"<p>I was having this error when trying to install Windows 7 off an old USB stick.</p>
<p>Nowadays laptops often don't have USB 2.0 ports.. so you might not have that option. And simply plugging an external one into a USB3 port probably won't help you in this case!</p>
<p>If you have a CD/DVD then some suggest using that, though often laptops don't have those built in.</p>
<p>A common suggestion is to slipstream USB3 drivers in. I saw a guy doing it in a youtube video (that i'll mention), and he used this article  <a href=""http://codeabitwiser.com/2014/03/how-to-install-windows-7-with-only-usb-3-0-ports/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://codeabitwiser.com/2014/03/how-to-install-windows-7-with-only-usb-3-0-ports/</a>  and it shows steps e.g. &quot;get the usb3 drivers,&quot; and further steps.   A Windows 7 ISO has two important files, boot.wim and install.wim and these are compressed files that can be opened/looked at in a program like 7-zip. The file install.wim has some folders named like 1,2,3 that each have the directory structure of a fresh windows installation.  There is a command called DISM that can be used to &quot;mount&quot; a WIM file to a directory, so you can add/remove files.  And there is also a command to automatically add USB drivers to an ISO (once you've downloaded the drivers). This video titled &quot;Adding USB3.0 Drivers to Windows 7 Pro Boot Drive&quot; by &quot;AnCrypthony M&quot;  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgF6FUeKCqQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgF6FUeKCqQ</a>  has him going through the article in that link.  One issue he didn't mention 'cos he didn't run into, is that you might get an error with the DISM command to install USB drivers  <a href=""https://www.sevenforums.com/drivers/394090-cant-slipstream-usb-3-0-drivers-windows-7-a.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.sevenforums.com/drivers/394090-cant-slipstream-usb-3-0-drivers-windows-7-a.html</a>   and have to &quot;unblock&quot; the file(sometimes files downloaded need that, it's an option in the properties of the file in windows). Perhaps you can also copy the USB related files to a directory on the media and then browse to it.</p>
<p>Personally, I found my ISO en_windows_7_ultimate_with_sp1_x64_dvd_u_677332.iso  worked fine.  (Whereas the USB stick win7 media even when slipstreamed, gave that error, which was strange. And on further investigation it had some qualities that looked like it wasn't 64bit e.g. no &quot;programs files (x86)&quot; directory in the install.wim). So you could try a fresh ISO like the one I mention there that worked for me!  Otherwise, a USB2.0 port, otherwise, slipstreaming the USB drivers in.</p>
<p>And there's also a tool from gigabyte, that might make it easy to make a windows 7 ISO slipstreamed with USB3 drivers <a href=""https://www.cybernetman.com/kb/article/how-to-slipstream-usb-3-0-drivers-into-windows-7-installation-media"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.cybernetman.com/kb/article/how-to-slipstream-usb-3-0-drivers-into-windows-7-installation-media</a></p>

<pre><code>ls | parallel mv {} destdir
</code></pre>
<p>So is there a way to get/print each file individually which was passed to parallel?</p>
<p><strong>Case for parallel processing</strong></p>
<p>I need to do parallel processing of checking multiple sites and record</p>
<ul>
<li>http return code (2xx, 4xx, 5xx)</li>
<li>The source URL</li>
<li>The ultimate destination URL</li>
<li>the curl exit code</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the code which does this:</p>
<pre><code>    unset return_code_array
    unset destination_url_array
    unset exit_code_array

    while read -r return_code_var destination_url_var exit_code_var; do

        destination_url_array+=(&quot;$destination_url_var&quot;)
        exit_code_array+=(&quot;$exit_code_var&quot;)
        return_code_array+=(&quot;$return_code_var&quot;)

    done &lt; &lt;(printf '%s\n' &quot;${all_valid_URLs_array[@]}&quot; | parallel -j 20 -k 'curl --max-time 20 -sL -o /dev/null -w &quot;%{response_code} %{url_effective} &quot; {}; printf &quot;%s %s\n&quot; &quot;$?&quot; ')
</code></pre>
<p>As a result, I have three arrays and they hold the HTTP return code, ultimate destination URL, and the curl exit code status for each corresponding line for the <code>all_valid_URLs_array</code> entries. I at the same time need to do some processing for each <code>destination_url_var</code> - like comparing if it matches to the source URL, but have no idea how to get the string which was passed to parallels.</p>
<p>Currently, I am running a second loop after the above one for such processing but want to know if I want to accomplish is possible.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>TLDR: disconnect the power plug from the PSU. Disconnect the 24 pin power connector and 4+4 pin CPU power connector from the mother board; disconnecting CMOS isn't necessary but probably wiser to do so. It seems the problem is the 'residual voltage' or whatever it's formally called.</p>
<p>So for the past 7 years, I've been running G.Skill low cas latency ripjaws with the Red colored plate, 2x2gb + 2x4gb for a total of 12GB DDR3 ram. Eventually upgraded from an AMD Phenom II to a 4th generation Intel i5 in 2018.
I bought the blue colored G.Skill rip jaws 2x8GB ram, in hopes of running 24GB total.
The <a href=""https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/Z87PLUS/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Asus Z87 plus</a> (link) is a very high end motherboard that comes with a power button, BIOS flashback, and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9azllBzU5PU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DRAM check button</a> (link) on it.</p>
<p>Went ahead and got a replacement motherboard on a eBay for way more money than it would have cost 2 years ago, but of course it came with expedited shipping. The Gigabyte motherboard was DOA, so I figured I'd plug the Asus back in since I remember reading a forum post about reseating the HSF to get it to boot.</p>
<p>Okay computer booted with 1 stick of ram. So common sense told me, I needed to get rid of the ground, I.e. make sure mobo is not connected and not touching the metallic computer case.
Since I'm lazy I only disconnected PSU power pins and power cable, and thankfully that's all that was needed.</p>
<p>I was able to get the computer running with 24GB, but there were bizarre inconsistent results. Sometimes I would have to turn off then turn on the monitor. The USB keyboard wouldn't emit a green light. I would restart the PC and then it wouldn't post.</p>
<p>So it made sense to stick with just 2x8GB and accept only getting a 25% increase in RAM.</p>

links. You will need to study well these articles, and the articles they link to,
before coming up with more questions.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing the boot media</strong></p>
<p>First, as there are different images for
<a href=""https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">different models of Chromebook</a>,
you need to choose the right one for your device.
In your case, the Acer c720 is marked in the &quot;Processor&quot; column as &quot;Intel Haswell&quot;.</p>
<p>Now you can download the
<a href=""https://galliumos.org/download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GalliumOS installation ISO image</a>
by clicking on the &quot;Haswell&quot; button.</p>
<p>Once you have the installation image, create a bootable USB drive with it.
The instructions for this are found on the GalliumOS website at
<a href=""https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Creating_Bootable_USB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Installing/Creating Bootable USB</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Backup before installation</strong></p>
<p>It is best to create a recovery image for your device in case something goes wrong
or if you decide that you want to go back to the current state.</p>
<p>You should create an image of your entire disk as backup, if you have enough
available disk media, for example by using Clonezilla.</p>
<p><strong>Installing GalliumOS</strong></p>
<p>Shut down the computer, plug in the USB drive containing the bootable
installation image, and restart, ensuring that the USB is used as the boot media.
The boot menu is entered from the BIOS by pressing
<kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>F2</kbd>, per your computer model.</p>
<p>The rest is a normal Linux installation, where the only difference is that you need
to re-format the entire disk as one partition.</p>

1607539,2,2020-12-05 11:45:53.177,0,"<p>In your example <code>'curl … {}; printf &quot;%s %s\n&quot; &quot;$?&quot; '</code> (why the second <code>%s</code>?) is a single-quoted piece of shell code. In it you can use <code>{}</code> more than once:</p>
<pre><code>curl … {}; printf &quot;%s %s\n&quot; &quot;$?&quot; {}
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively create a variable and use it as many times as you want. The name of the variable can be descriptive, this is an advantage. There's another advantage: in general what gets substituted for <code>{}</code> can be a long string, substituting it many times may bloat the code <code>parallel</code> will pass to particular shells. IMO it's better to substitute once and let the shell save the string and reuse it:</p>
<pre><code>source_URL={}; curl … &quot;$source_URL&quot;; printf &quot;%s %s\n&quot; &quot;$?&quot; &quot;$source_URL&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><sup>In case of GNU <code>parallel</code> it's safe to embed <code>{}</code> in the shell code. It's an exception explicitly mentioned in this answer: <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/156010/108618""><em>Never embed <code>{}</code> in the shell code!</em></a>. You probably already know this, the remark is for a general audience.</sup></p>
<p>Note you need to adjust your <code>read</code> in the main loop, it now has to read into <em>four</em> variables. This way you will transfer the source URL from the inside of <code>parallel</code> to the main loop where you can compare it to <code>destination_url_var</code> or do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Still in this approach &quot;whatever you want&quot; is not parallelized.</p>
<p>If you capture the output from <code>curl</code> to separate variables inside the shell code run by <code>parallel</code> (instead of just printing it to be captured outside of <code>parallel</code>) then you will be able to do comparison (or whatever you want) <em>there</em>, in parallel. And e.g. <code>printf</code> <em>conditionally</em>. It's up to you where you implement the desired logic, as long as the inside of <code>parallel</code> generates output in the form expected by the outside <code>read</code>.</p>
<p>The shell code passed to <code>parallel</code> still needs to be single-quoted. As it grows, you may need to use (embed) single-quotes in this very code; then quoting will get somewhat complicated and less readable. In such situation consider moving the code to a separate script where you can quote independently. You will invoke it from the main script like this:</p>
<pre><code>while read … ; done &lt; &lt;( … | parallel -j 20 -k 'path/to/separate_script {}' )
</code></pre>
<p>Inside the <code>separate_script</code> the string substituted for <code>{}</code> will be available as <code>$1</code> (don't forget to <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/131767/108618"">double-quote it</a>).</p>

<p>When you connect using password authentication, the sshd  preserves the username and password in memory as part of the Windows &quot;logon session&quot;.

<p>But when you connect using SSH publickey authentication, the sshd does not know your password, and Windows does not have any way to log in to SMB fileservers without it.   You need to manually connect to those using <code>net use '\\DNVM'</code> and provide the password for each connection.</p>

<p>I need to install a BIOS operating system, and also an UEFI OS, on the same PC. So I am thinking about doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all disks except one, install the BIOS OS on the disk</li>
<li>Remove all disks except one, install the UEFI OS on this other disk</li>

<p>(For future reference; the reason you should not install UEFI and BIOS operating systems on one disk is this: BIOS OSes requires the disk be formatted MBR style. UEFI OSes requires the disk be formatted GPT style. So you have either a MBR disk or GPT disk, not both. So only one OS will work, the other will not. This is the reason you should not install BIOS and UEFI OSes on the same disk. However, if you install it on different disks, I think if it should work? If not, why?)</p>

<p>In my experience, Apple macOS updates are cumulative in downloads. Meaning when you closed the lid on your MacBook all that happened is the download was suspended. It will not start from square one again. It will simply continue the download where it left off.

Recap, creating a scheduled task with the operator user to execute a script creating a file in the s:\ disk.
After realising it wasn't working, I tried breaking down the problem into steps. First I tried executing the powershell script with the operator user. The script is the following:</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why can I create the file in C:\Users\operator\Documents but not in C:\</li>
<li>Why do I have the run as administrator for it to work if operator is already the admin ?</li>
<li>Would the reason why my scheduled task is not working the same as why I can't write in c:\ ?</li>

<p>I'm wondering if this will affect my cpu long term in ANY way.</p>

<p><strong>Everything</strong> will affect your CPU life in <strong>SOME</strong> way.</p>
<p>It is just that many things (like your copying data from one HDD to another) do so in such a minuscule way, it is not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>So yes, your use of CPU for few hours will shorten it's life by few hours.
You would also shorten it's life for few hours if it was showing screensaver for few hours, instead of copying your data. And even if computer was turned off, the CPU (and other components) would age (albeit at a usually much slower rate).</p>
<p>So to answer your question: <strong>It doesn't matter</strong> as the effect is incredibly small. Just copy the things you need to copy.</p>
<p>Anyway, the rest of your computer system (like motherboard and aforementioned HDDs) will very likely die much sooner than your CPU, leaving your computer useless.
And probably, even before that motherboard and disks die, your computer will be so obsolete that you will not be using it even if it was still functional (like, find a few decades years old computer in museum and try to make it do such a simple task as browsing this web site)</p>

1607656,2,2020-12-06 00:14:48.867,0,"<p>When you try to run <code>rm *.bar</code> and there is no file that matches <code>*.bar</code>, basically two things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The POSIX behavior is the shell runs <code>rm</code> with literal <code>*.bar</code> as an argument. The tool tries to remove a file literally named <code>*.bar</code> (as if you run <code>rm '*.bar'</code>), it fails and prints something like <code>rm: *.bar: No such file or directory</code>. This is how the POSIX shell (<code>sh</code>) and compatible shells behave.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-POSIX behavior is the shell detects there is no match, prints something like <code>no matches found: *.bar</code> and doesn't run <code>rm</code> <em>at all</em>. This is how Zsh behaves by default. (For comparison: in Bash you can switch to this behavior by <code>shopt -s failglob</code>.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An error from <code>rm</code> (the former case) is printed to the stderr of <code>rm</code>. An error from the shell (the latter case) is printed to the stderr of the shell.</p>
<p>The redirection in <code>rm *.bar 2&gt;/dev/null</code> affects the stderr of <code>rm</code> only<sup>+</sup>. In your example <code>rm</code> doesn't even run.</p>
<p>To redirect the stderr of the shell you need <code>exec</code>. Example:</p>
<pre><code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>In Zsh you can even close it:</p>
<pre><code>exec 2&gt;&amp;-
</code></pre>
<p>A reasonable approach is to duplicate the original stderr beforehand, just in case you need to use (or restore) it later. Example (note if you want to paste this code into an interactive Zsh then you should invoke <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/557490/108618""><code>setopt interactive_comments</code></a> first):</p>
<pre class=""lang-bsh prettyprint-override""><code>exec 7&gt;&amp;2           # &quot;save&quot; stderr
exec 2&gt;/dev/null    # redirect
rm *.bar
whatever
exec 2&gt;&amp;7           # restore
exec 7&gt;&amp;-           # close descriptor which is no longer needed
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>7</code> is an arbitrary single-digit number, otherwise unused as a file descriptor. The first two lines can be written as one: <code>exec 7&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;/dev/null</code>; similarly the last two lines can.</p>
<p>Note <code>rm</code> or any command (like <code>whatever</code>) invoked without stderr redirection inherits stderr from the shell. This means in the above example <code>rm</code> (if it ever runs) and <code>whatever</code> will print their error messages (if any) to <code>/dev/null</code>. After <code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null</code> you can invoke any number or commands and they all will have <code>/dev/null</code> as their stderr. If you really want to suppress all kinds of error messages then this is the way.</p>
<p>The solution works in many shells, not only in Zsh. If you want to redirect stderr of an interactive shell then keep in mind some less sophisticated shells use stderr to print their prompt.</p>
<p>Note a process may redirect its own stderr (like our shell does with <code>exec 2&gt;…</code>); or it can print error messages to stdout or to <code>/dev/tty</code> (it shouldn't, but it technically can). Therefore <code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null</code> does <em>not</em> guarantee you will see no messages that look like error messages.</p>
<p>After <code>exec 2&gt;/dev/null</code> you still can redirect stderr of any command on demand. E.g. if instead <code>whatever</code> we had:</p>
<pre><code>whatever 2&gt;&amp;7
</code></pre>
<p>then its error messages would go to the original stderr we deliberately saved as file descriptor <code>7</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>+</sup> Strictly: it affects &quot;<code>rm</code>&quot; before and after it becomes (or tries to become) <code>rm</code>. Bear with me. The redirection in <code>rm … 2&gt;/dev/null</code> starts as a redirection performed by a <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/31118/108618"">forked shell that is about to replace itself with <code>rm</code> executable</a>. This shell redirects its own stderr before it tries to replace itself with <code>rm</code>. Any error it reports after performing the redirection will go to <code>/dev/null</code>. E.g. if <code>rm</code> is not to be found then the already performed redirection will suppress the <code>command not found</code> error.</p>

<p>Note <code>awk</code> is a tool very well suited to deal with the problem.
