1606328,2020-12-01 00:43:37.633,0,"<p>I have a very quick question regarding the IO shield in my PC build. I'm a complete beginner when it comes to this, so this might be a silly question. I've recently started building a computer but I've hit a bit of an issue that's taken me around in circles.</p>
<p>The case I've got is a Obsidian 500D case and the motherboard I have is a MSI MPG Z490. I've installed the CPU, RAM and SSD on to the board no problem, but I've had an issue with screwing the board into the case itself.</p>
<p>The reason I bought the case was because it supported this motherboard (I used the site pcpartpicker.com to confirm this). When I go to place the motherboard in the case, the screw holes in the board don't fully align with the standoffs on the case. I've try wiggling the board around to try and see if I can align it, but to no avail.</p>
<p>But funnily enough, I removed the IO-shield from the motherboard (It came pre-attached to it) and tried again with aligning the board. And, it aligned perfectly. With no problems at all. My question is, is this normal? Surely it should just fit on without having to go through the need to remove the IO-shield? That's needed, right?</p>
<p>I've also tried taking the IO-shield off, placing it in the case, then attaching the motherboard but it doesn't align (like before). Although, the IO-shield doesn't snap into place when I put it in the case. After looking online most other builds I've seen have the IO-shield snap into place, so perhaps I'm being too gentle? One thing I did note was that the IO-shield seems to be a little too thin, i.e. it could be moved a little bit left and right in the slot (which I assume comes from it not being snapped into place?)</p>
<p>Thank you for the help in advance! :)</p>

1606345,2020-12-01 02:25:49.737,0,"<p>Currently, we use some logic in PowerShell to do a <code>netstat -ano</code> to get all TCP and UDP results and filter out results that we don't need to see then export it into a CSV. We want the results to only include the <em><strong>LISTENING</strong></em> and <em><strong>(blank)</strong></em> and <em><strong>non-loopback IP's</strong></em>.</p>
<p>One example would be <code>netstat -ano  | Where-Object{$_ -notlike '*127.?.?.?*' -and $_ -notmatch '\[::1]' -and $_ -notmatch 'TIME_WAIT' -and $_ -notmatch 'CLOSE*' -and $_ -notmatch 'ESTABLISHED' -and $_ -notmatch 'SYN_*' -and $_ -notmatch 'FIN_*'}</code>.</p>

I can go to it by typing in &quot;E:&quot; in my file browser, but it is just completely blank with no files.</p>
<p>I cannot reformat it, as no actual program I've used detects its existence, and the USB stick is basically just...gone.  Even Rufus itself can no longer detect the USB stick, even with the &quot;List USB Hard Drives&quot; option.  And since there's no way to manually type in what drive to format in Rufus (or any other USB formatter that I've found), I am unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>Windows (my main machine runs 7) does not detect the stick through CMD's chkdsk, nor the file explorer, and if I force the system to recognize it by just going to &quot;E:&quot; manually (the drive disappears from the listings again when I click away from the drive), right clicking on the drive and selecting &quot;Format&quot; does nothing.

1606408,2020-12-01 08:34:02.553,0,"<p>I would like to install a Matrix homesever on a VPS (running Debian 10) for the sole purpose of using the WhatsApp bridge, <code>mautrix-whatsapp</code>. I really only need to be able to communicate with my personal WhatsApp using a Matrix client, so there's no need to use federation or anything like that (AFAICT). Since this use is a bit different from common homeserver setups, I was hoping someone could elucidate a few things for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>The VPS in question mostly serves as an OpenVPN server. I would like to have the Matrix homeserver only accessible from clients connected to the VPN. To the OpenVPN clients, the server is accessible by IP at 192.168.xxx.1. Clients connect to the VPN by IP; there is no <em>externally</em> accessible FQDN associated with it. Is this going to be a problem? N.B. the VPN clients typically use the DNS server (Pi-hole) running on the VPS, which does allow them to reach the server by its hostname. Can I just use this hostname as the domain namee for Synapse and mautrix-whatsapp?</li>
<li>Port 443 is NOT available, because I redirect it to 1194 so clients can connect to the VPN on restrictive public networks. Although <a href=""https://www.natrius.eu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=digital:server:matrixsynapse"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a> says &quot;a reverse proxy should be reachable publicly with a regular certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt) on port 443 that goes to the port 8008 of synapse&quot;, I'm assuming things will work out just fine if I use a different port and point the Matrix client (Element) to it. Is that correct?</li>
<li>In fact, since the client connections will already be encrypted by virtue of OpenVPN, could I forgo the reverse proxy entirely? If so, is that sensible, and is there anything I need to know w.r.t. configuration, etc?</li>
<li>In this configuration, do either Synapse or mautrix-whatsapp require me to open ports to the outside world (i.e. outside of the VPN's 192.168.xxx.0/24)?</li>

<p>I don't understand why I can't show every graduation on the X axis of the graph. The graph is showing &quot;2000Q1, 2000Q3, 2001Q1, 2000Q3...&quot; and I would want something like &quot;2000Q1, 2000Q2, 2000Q3, 2000Q4...&quot;.</p>
<p>And when I go into the parameters of the graph and to the graduation category, I don't find an option helping me.</p>

1606482,2020-12-01 15:30:19.300,0,"<p>I recently set up a Raspberry Pi NAS. It has a USB 3.0 connection to a hard drive with a Raspberry Pi 4. The problem is that when I copy files with Samba I only get around 10 MiB/sec.</p>
<p>I know the problem isn't with the hard drive nor the USB 3.0 SATA connector. I copied a big file from the hard drive back to the hard drive itself and was getting around 80 MiB/sec. I also ran hdparm and it had a read value also around 80 MiB/sec. I checked the ethernet connection and it is connected with 100 Mbps link. When I ran speed test to the internet (just to check if I'm getting that 100 Mbps on the network), it did gave me values close to 100 Mbps.</p>
<p>From what I've seen as described above, I can conclude that the problem must be with Samba. I changed my file according to the <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/713248/home-file-server-using-samba-slow-read-and-write-speed"">first answer of this question</a>.</p>
<p>I checked the amount of RAM available and CPU usage during copying files through samba - that wasn't a problem. I had over 1 gig of ram available and CPU usage was just around 5% for all cores (my raspberry pi has 4 cores).</p>

Each sheet is labeled with a Date code. 20201129, 20201128, 20201127</p>
<p>I have a formula on the first Sheet &quot;total&quot; <code>=sum('20201129:20201127'!A1)</code>. This works.
When I add a new data sheet called 20201130 to the left of 20201129, I would like to have the formula update to <code>=sum('20201130:20201127'!A1).</code>
Unfortunately, I cant find anything like <code>=sum(sheet(2):'20201127'!A1)</code> that would dynamically add the new second sheet (or last sheet if I add to the end)
I know I could add the new sheet to the right of the 2nd sheet and that is what I am doing but it isn't as elegant. I am trying to avoid a hidden sheet (also for elegance)</p>

1606574,2020-12-01 20:50:58.540,0,"<p>I have a long report that has developed the problem of an unusually thick border. There is nothing in the footer and I have created an example document that is an emptied version of my report document with one thing in the header. The thick footer is greatly restricting how much I can fit on each page. How can I remove this thick border and return to default. Copying and pasting the entire report into a new document brings back these chunky footers. The ruler shows the footer size to be default yet in reality its much bigger. Removing footer does nothing. Changing the position does nothing. There is no spacing. This is literally driving me insane.</p>
<p>edit: I decided to re-create the report by making a new document and copying very small sections of text only. After slowly adding the original report in bit by bit, it seemed like the thick footer appeared while adding a certain line of text just before the number of columns changed. After further investigation I found that when I used different numbers of columns on the same page, other strange things started happening. Pages that were made using page breaks were undeletable after changing page size with no text cursor on the page and delete and backspace doing nothing, page size of the first page was not respected when adding a new page, an page was created at the end of the document at some point in my investigation with the same font as the line earlier in the report that caused the thick footer and was unable to be changed or the page removed. Other stuff happened that is very hard to explain clearly without an essay. Also I should mention that the default template is completely fine. The document I have shown as an example has nothing in it at all and the text style set to normal. My guess is that the template I'm required to use is old and broken. My new report document that I made from scratch to look like the template works.</p>

1606583,2020-12-01 21:31:47.000,0,"<p>I just setup my HP Notebook with 2 instances of Windows 10, installed on a single drive, and using UEFI style dual boot (i.e.: the bootloader starts that blue option screen letting me choose between the two instances, as opposed to the classic black/white BIOS type screen). Both Win10 instances are booting and working fine, so I could be happy with the result.</p>
<p>The weird thing is: the 1st instance (&quot;Windows 10 MAIN&quot;) boots blazingly fast, and directly into the windows login screen after selecting it at the bootloader screen.</p>
<p>The 2nd instance  (&quot;Windows 10 MUSIC&quot;) though apparently does a complete reboot, this time without presenting the UEFI dual boot selection screen. Instead, after a (short) while, it finally gets to the &quot;Windows 10 MUSIC&quot; login screen. From then on everything appears to be normal. So this is more a curiosity-type question:</p>
<p>is this just the normal / weird Windows way, or did something go wrong during the setup?</p>

<p>maybe it helps explaining how I set this system up:</p>
<ol>
<li>installed Windows 10 MAIN to a previously wiped SSD; set the partition size to ~190 GB. The installation created the necessary additional partitions, the rest of the drive remained untouched</li>
<li>booted into Windows 10 MAIN and changed the &quot;display title&quot; for the future selection menu using bcdedit</li>
<li>rebooted to the setup image; created a fresh partition of ~150 GB, installed &quot;Windows 10 MUSIC&quot; to that partition</li>
<li>booted into Windows 10 MUSIC and changed the &quot;display title&quot; for the future selection menu using bcdedit</li>

<p>I installed Ubuntu 18.04 on both of them, and I noticed that even though the exact same version of Ubuntu was installed on both (Ubuntu Server 18.04.5 LTS), neither of them have any packages that can be upgraded, and the hardware is also the exact same between both machines (only difference is the NAS has a larger SSD and more RAM than the gateway, everything else is the same), these two machines have different kernel versions.</p>
<p>I know very little about the Linux kernel or what its different versions means. I'm curious what is the difference between Linux Kernel version <code>5.3.0-1039-gke</code> (the one which is installed on my NAS) and Linux Kernel <code>4.15.0-124-generic</code> (the one installed on my gateway). Also possibly worth mentioning that neither of these machines came with an OS installed (or hard disk).</p>
<p>Both of these are running the same Ubuntu installation that I flashed onto a USB flash drive, both were installed onto new, fresh/blank SSDs.

My laptop is a 2016 Lenovo Z51 with a magnetic HD, and it recently started making strange sounds while idle about once every two hours or so. It's closer to a loud chirp than the clicking I've heard with other drives, but I'm worried that it's the hard drive.</p>
<p>Things I've tried to rule out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy/extended hard drive seek noises (e.g. when swapping, swapoffing, or opening large directories/files): The odd sound is louder and isolated and seemingly happens even when idle, not just when I know there's I/O.</li>
<li>Isolated hard drive seek noises (e.g. with &lt;10 terminals open or when browsing): With light I/O, I often get similar sounds, but the recent noises are much louder.</li>
<li>Speaker mute/unmute noises: Muting/unmuting the speaker on Windows (but not Linux with ALSA or Pulseaudio) produces a loud click, but it's just a mildly irritating burst of white noise and not a chirping sound.</li>
<li>Stray audio: I don't have any system sounds in my default environment, and the chirps persist even when muted.</li>

<p>My question is mostly one of whether I should run fsck at this point as opposed to replacing the drive (or if it's something innocuous).

1606749,2020-12-02 13:34:30.143,0,"<p>Since some time my PC gives (3 beeps, pause, 3 beeps, reboot) repeatedly on boot. Nothing on the screen.
Googling for this beep code gave me no meaningful results (it's certainly not a keyboard problem).
After many (around 30) tries of booting, it sometimes gets through and then I can use my PC for days (without powering down) without a problem. But once a few days my screens are black, keyboard lights frozen. After restarting my PC, I'm again faced with the boot issue.</p>
<p>My first though was that it is a GPU problem, as I could boot when I removed my GPU and used my motherboard video. However, that seems to have been a fluke.</p>
<p>Today removing the GPU didn't help as well and I started investigating further. I removed all devices attached to my PC. I unplugged all SATA cables (I don't have an M.2 SSD), removed my GPU, used a different PSU and removed 2 of the 3RAM sticks, changing which one of the 3 I used. I did a CMOS reset and used a new CMOS battery. I still couldn't boot, with the same beep code.</p>
<p>I plugged everything in again and started the boot loop. After about 20 minutes the PC finally booted successfuly. After confirming the UEFI default settings, and a rather long boot, Windows started without problems.</p>
<p>So... that's the current situation. I can use my PC but I'm afraid of rebooting it or powering down for any reason.</p>
<p>I guess it must be something related to the motherboard or CPU as I ruled out virtually everything else.</p>

1606805,2020-12-02 17:29:47.637,0,"<p>I have a VS running Ubuntu 20.04 with working web server and email server. I connect a CentOS box to it via VPN from home. The CentOS also has a web server and Postfix email server. The web and email servers work on the CentOS box as long as (a) ports 80 and 25 are forwarded from the VS machine, and (b) CentOS is connected to VS machine with VPN. The conundrum is that both web servers (on VS and CentOS) are accessible from public Internet when port 80 is forwarded from VS, but email receiving works only on CentOS. Postfix on the VS rejects incoming mail with <code>Relay access denied</code>. If I remove forwarding port 25 Postfix on VS does receive mail, but CentOS will not. Same situation if I change master.cf on VS from smtp to smtps (not using the forwarded port 25). How can I set up the VS Postfix so it accepts incoming mail while port 25 is forwarded - just as Apache can serve web pages from both machines while port 80 is fowarded from the VS machine? Note: port forwarding and VPN access to the VS machine is necessary otherwise CentOS on home Internet access is restricted by ISP with blocking incoming ports 80 and 25.</p>

<p>Always wanted a network drive for backup and family storage, so I was thinking about converting it to a NAS system. However, after some researching, I haven't notice anyone talking about building NAS with a Chromebook on ChromeOS.</p>
<p>My requirements aren't high, or at least I don't think they are (it's my first time trying it):</p>
<ul>
<li>4~8TB RAID1 (ideally)</li>
<li>~150MB/s Read</li>
<li>&gt;50MB/s Write</li>
<li>It is for personal/family use, so downtimes/weekly maintenance are fine(as long it's not too difficult)</li>
<li>Power wattage wouldn't be a problem since I don't pay for electric, plus they seem to use low wattage anyways</li>
</ul>
<p>It has 2 USB-A 3.0 port, and 1 USB-C data port.</p>
<hr />
<h3>My question:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is it possibly to do them within ChromeOS without too much digging around? (I don't mind using Debian inside ChromeOS)</li>
<li>Should I just install a different system them was purposed for NAS?</li>

1606914,2020-12-03 02:38:00.343,0,"<p>This is from a long time ago — so I'm probably unable to provide clear details — but I accidentally did something really dumb with a family member's external hard drive.</p>
<p>If I am remembering the details as correctly as I can, but I think it was a Western Digital drive, one of those My Passport models probably, I don't know which one for sure. I think what happened was is I was cleaning up and absentmindedly plugged in a cable into it and into a computer thinking it was fine because it fit.</p>
<p>I believe what I foolishly did was plug in a USB 2.0 to Micro-B External HDD cable into it but the cable it took was a USB 3.0 to Micro-B External HDD cable. I just remember that ports were similar but just that cable I plugged into it was so like half the size of the actual port on the drive.</p>
<p>So ever since I did that, the drive doesn't seem to power on/be recognized by the computer anymore. Is this drive beyond saving? I was never able to find anything that could help me determine if I had accidentally completely toasted the drive or if the only thing I broke was like the plug interface, so that it just wasn't receiving power and perhaps the data on the drive itself was still accessible in some way.</p>

1606915,2020-12-03 02:42:12.627,0,"<p>My department used to be a small department. As is common with small groups, system security wasn't really enforced. In short, everyone used the same login account and had root access.
As the department has grown (about 50 people and still growing) and we've moved on to more of a production role, we've had to adjust our habits.</p>
<p>We recently implemented network logins. With this came noone has root access (or sudo).
The amount of pushback I have received from this is tremendous (as is expected) as not everyone can just <code>sudo fix problem</code>. However, sudo is dangerous, and most users are electrical engineers who aren't unix savvy. After explaining why we will not be getting sudo back, their is still tremendous pushback.</p>
<p>This is where I turn to stack exchange. As I have looked on google for why not everyone should have root access. And surprisingly, this information is hard to come by. I have tried making a list myself, but it would be good to have another online source backing up what I'm saying, which I thought there would be a plethora of articles for!</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons they want sudo access back, and how I addressed their concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can't edit other user's files in a shared directory
<ul>
<li>Don't use shared directories to edit your code. Everyone should be editing in their own home directories and pushing to git. Let git do it's job and merge stuff.</li>
<li>If for whatever reason you <em>need</em> to use shared directories, have the directory owner give the group write permissions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While using a shared directory, if one person compiles, the others can no longer compile as they'd have to remove the first binary
<ul>
<li>Same response as (1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If one person pushes to git with no group write permission, the others cannot push to git
<ul>
<li>For now, set your umask (i told them how to do this). Soon, IT will be taking over all git remote ownership and will be setting up shared permissions properly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other reasons I have come up with for why sudo access would not be good.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can't accidentally delete customer data forever (this has happened)</li>
<li>We can't <code>sudo reboot</code> and kick everyone off whos remotely logged in (someone kicked me off a few times and I lost my work)</li>
<li>It restricts what we can run (in a good way!). One time someone installed Debian GUI libraries they found online, but we run CentOS.</li>

<p>I did not mention exact version of BRIX. Its Gigabyte BRIX GB-BLCE-4105</p>
<p>After going through some reviews, I found that UEFI support is hard coded in the firmware and it simply does not support leagacy OS support.</p>
<p>My further questions will be:</p>
<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Is that even possible to hardcode UEFI support and not support legacy mode at all? (I guess yes, it all depends on how firmware is coded, but need confirmation)</p>
<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Is it fixable? With say firmware updates / flashing or some other approaches?</p>

1607050,2020-12-03 14:10:44.873,13,"<p>As in previous versions of Windows, a user can change the screen resolution or the monitor setup in Windows 10 using the control panel. However, the dialog that asks for confirmation (&quot;Do you really want to change the screen resolution?&quot;) has a button with a timeout of approximately 15 seconds. If you do not press this button within the desired period of time, the changes will be reverted, probably in order to prevent the user from switching any resolution that their monitor setup does not support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this button is only accessible by mouse, or at least I fail to find a Shortcut (like Alt-y for &quot;yes&quot;), so the very simple question is:</p>
<p>How can this button be accessed using only a keyboard?</p>

1607177,2020-12-03 23:16:58.220,2,"<p>Before anyone asks if this has been asked before, it has, but I haven't found a recent enough and/or satisfactory answer, so I hope the situation has changed.</p>
<p>I have 3 monitors (well, 2 + TV) and need to switch between them often enough that the default Windows GUI way (which involves about 10 clicks, some scrolling and some waiting) is getting on my nerves. This is on a home PC runnign Windows 10 Pro if relevant.</p>
<p>There are two setups that I need to toggle between, see image:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4oIyf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Display setups</a></p>
<p>Case one: <strong>display 1</strong>: main, 2560x1440 <strong>display 2</strong>: disconnected <strong>display 3</strong>: 1920x1080, rotated by 90°, extending desktop</p>
<p>Case two: <strong>display 1</strong>: main, 1920x1080 <strong>display 2</strong>: duplicating 1 <strong>display 3</strong>: disconnected</p>
<p>I want to have a short script that would on execution simply toggle between the two configutation, so that I would reduce all that configuration to a single doubleclick from desktop. I expected there would be something that would allow me to select a display by its Windows-assigned ID and set its properties the way I have summed up above. Surely if you can do it via clicking in the GUI, there must be a way to do it via command line? But I found none.</p>
<p>There is the MS displayswitch.exe tool which is way too basic for this case.</p>
<p>An often recommended tool is the MultiMonitor Tool from Nirsoft. In my experience it fails at this because it seems unable to set display as duplicate, and also it seems to get confused which display is which. I tried saving both configurations while they were active and then loading them, and it botches the job, ending up with something completely different.</p>

1607184,2020-12-04 00:04:30.217,0,"<p>So, I discovered a strange quirk of the Windows 10 ping utility. If you ping a whole number instead of an IP address, it will &quot;convert&quot; that number to an IPv4 address. The conversion is such that the first octet is your 256^3 spot, second octet is 256^2, third is 256^1, and the last octet being the &quot;ones&quot; place or 256^0.</p>
<p>For example &quot;ping 200&quot; will ping 0.0.0.200, but &quot;ping 400&quot; will ping 0.0.1.144, where the &quot;1&quot; in the third octet represents 256 (256 + 144 = 400).</p>
<p>A quick Google search (although I couldn't think of a great search term) didn't bring anything.</p>
<p>My only two theories are this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It may be the case that in an earlier iteration of the IP schema (i.e. the unused v1, v2, or v3), the plan was to just use single whole numbers. Microsoft, in its' obsession with backwards compatibility wrote a translation algorithm into the ping utility to handle this way way back when ping was first coded.</li>
<li>It may be the case that due to the way the ping utility is coded, it normally takes a valid IPv4 address and translates it to a single whole number before doing something with that data. Thus, as a check in the code, if it sees that the user entered a single whole number, it just skips that initial translation step.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any ideas? It definitely intrigued my co-workers, but they were just as clueless as I am.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just tested it on my Arch Linux machine, and I can confirm that the behavior exists there as well, so that likely discredits my first theory.</p>

1607262,2020-12-04 08:27:04.677,0,"<p>To start off, my knowledge in networking is quite limited so I apologize in advance if I am using the wrong terminology.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>I'm trying to create a prototype that will allow clients to communicate with a local web server on a different network. The webserver is hosted on the same network as the VPN server.
So far, I'm able to route the client packet (ex: SYN) to a virtual interface (tun) and send the entire packet to the VPN Server. On the Server side, I receive these packets, change the source and destination IPs, and recalculate the checksums inside the headers.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the flow is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>User tries to access web server with a certain ip address.</li>
<li>The SYN packet is sent to the virtual interface because it matches routes in the routing table.</li>
<li>The VPN Client application sends the SYN packet to the VPN Server through an established websocket connection (shouldn't matter what kind of connection this is)</li>
<li>The VPN Server receives the packet and modifies the source / destination ip address to point to the actual web server hosted on the same network.</li>
<li>How do I send these packets to the webserver and receive responses from the webserver? I want the client to communicate with the webserver through the VPN server / established web socket connection. What are some options I have?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>How can I send these packets to the web server, and receives packets back from the webserver to send back to the client? Do I &quot;inject&quot; packets into the correct interface and make sure my application sends the responses back to the client? I want the client to communicate with the webserver through the VPN server / established web socket connection. What are some options I have and in general, how do current VPN Server's do this?</p>
<h3>What I have tried</h3>
<p>What I've tried to do on the server side is I've created a virtual interface (tun) and wrote the packets received from the client into the interface. However, these packets do not get sent out to the webserver. The client and server are running on macOS using Network Extensions if that is of any use. The web server is running on <code>192.168.1.95</code>, and I've modified the packet's source IP to <code>100.64.0.77</code> before writing to the <code>tun</code> interface.</p>

<p>I'm now considering to solve this problem by putting lines starting with the “<strong>&quot;,</strong>” character combination on the previous line.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: what should I do to format this CSV data set in such a way that all rows starting with “<strong>&quot;,</strong>” are put on their respective previous lines? (Either in Notepad++ or Excel.)</p>

1607333,2020-12-04 14:19:36.913,1,"<p>I have an Excel workbook that has sheets that include columns where it is required to average the lowest 7 from 25 values excluding any with a 0, e.g any cells with a value greater than 1.  In the example below column Z is used and the values are contained in rows 13 to 38.  In a number of rows the sum of the value in column Z is 0.</p>
<p>The formula I have is =SUMPRODUCT(SMALL(Z$13:Z$38,{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}))/7</p>
<p>This works but only if, for example, the rows that return a 0 are either blank or contains a &quot;-&quot;.</p>
<p>This creates a problem as the rows have formula that are the sum of other cells in that row. For example Z20 has a formula that is the sum of M20 plus W20 which are the sum of D20:L20 &amp; N20:V20 respectively.  Although D20:L20 and N20:V20 are unpopulated the sum in M20 &amp; W20 both return a 0.  The cells D20:L20 &amp; N20:V20 will only be populated at a later date.</p>
<p>By entering a &quot;-&quot; or pressing delete to remove the 0 I also remove the formula. It then becomes necessary to re-enter the formula when populating the cells which is possible but not ideal due to the number of sheets involved and potential for error.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this problem?</p>

<p>I have a machine that is treated as an appliance, it has multiple graphical applications open, and these must not be closed at any time.</p>
<p>HumanA might turn on the system, launch the applications, then lock the screen.</p>
<p>There is a shift change, and HumanB now takes the responsibility of the machine.</p>
<p>HumanB now needs to log into the system, and see the same graphical applications that HumanA launched.</p>
<p><strong>How I do it today</strong></p>
<p>Today we achieve this by having one user account (UserX) and both HumanA and HumanB know the password to UserX.</p>
<p>The problem is with the auditing of this system.  If we determine something very bad happened over the weekend, the log file would only tell us that UserX logged in.  This fails to meet our regulations.</p>
